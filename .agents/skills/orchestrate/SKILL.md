name: orchestrate
description: Run broad bigname execution work in orchestration mode. Use whenever the task is large, multi-slice, parallelizable, or should be delegated instead of implemented directly in the current session. This skill makes the current session orchestrate the work. Read docs, classify the change, create bounded tasks, spawn subagents, steer them, and integrate their results without doing most implementation locally.

# Orchestrate

`$phased-continuation` and `$parallel-pickup` are thin mode wrappers around this skill. Their bodies defer here.

## Core role

- Delegate implementation — including docs, task breakdown, and analysis. Don't edit product code, tests, manifests, fixtures, migrations, or docs unless delegation is blocked.
- Keep your own work to scoping, task design, delegation, follow-up, conflict resolution, synthesis.

## Repo rules

See `AGENTS.md` for Guardrails, Boundaries, and High Conflict. Apply them on every delegation.

Split work along `docs/workstreams.md` boundaries when possible.

## Modes

- **default** — bounded task; fan out only if needed.
- **broad** (triggered by `$parallel-pickup` or requests to parallelize) — split a large task into disjoint owned slices and run workers concurrently.
- **continuation** (triggered by `$phased-continuation` or "keep going") — loop: research → execute → research. See that skill for loop-specific rules.

## Subagents

Shared subagents live in `.codex/agents/*.toml`. Dispatch as follows:

- `next_slice_researcher` (read-only) — picks the next viable thin slice. Use for "what should we work on next?" and at the top of continuation loops. Emits the slice envelope.
- `task_designer` (read-only) — decomposes a chosen slice into owned subagent tasks. Consumes the slice envelope; produces a task set with explicit file ownership.
- `docs_writer` — writes or updates docs, task writeups, doc-first semantic changes. Not read-only because its job is to edit under `docs/` and task notes.
- `verification_reviewer` (read-only) — cross-slice review for correctness, boundary compliance, missing validation. Use when risk is high or multiple workers edited adjacent surfaces.
- built-in `worker` — bounded implementation task. Give it owned paths, outcome, and validation.

## Dispatching subagents

Typed subagents (anything defined in `.codex/agents/*.toml`) take a scoped prompt, not a fork of the parent thread. Compose each call with only what the subagent needs: the slice envelope or the relevant fields, owned paths, the exact deliverable, success signal. Do not try to inherit full conversation context — that dispatch mode is rejected and wastes a round-trip on retry.

## Waiting on subagents

Subagents take minutes, not seconds. Slow is not stuck.

- Do not cancel or restart a live subagent because it feels slow. Cancellation requires concrete evidence of being stuck: silence for several minutes AND no sign of work in the latest output. Reading files, running searches, and writing code are work, not silence.
- Do not spawn duplicates of in-flight work. Before spawning, read `.agents/state/slices.jsonl`.
- If a live subagent seems off-track, ask it for a status update. Do not kill and restart.
- If there is nothing else to steer, wait. Spawning more agents because you feel idle is the failure mode.

## Playbook routing

Dispatch to a playbook skill when the change touches its surface. Playbooks are libraries, not entry points:

- `$change-gate` — classify shared-interface vs implementation-only. Run first whenever semantics, IDs/enums, manifests, migrations, ownership, or parity claims may change. Output fills the envelope's `change_class`, `docs_to_update`, `write_owner`.
- `$capability-slice` — consumer-capability mapping to routes, projections, tests, rollout criteria.
- `$manifest-rollout` — manifest, discovery, capability-flag, invalidation changes.
- `$replay-boundaries` — replay, canonicality, projection rebuilds, execution-boundary work.

## Slice envelope

All research, design, and review subagents communicate via a shared schema. See `references/slice-envelope.md` for the canonical fields and how they compose with `$change-gate` output. Extend subagent prompts to emit or consume it rather than inventing per-agent output shapes.

## Slice log

When fanning out or looping, append to `.agents/state/slices.jsonl` — one JSON line per event:

```
{"slice_id": "...", "status": "picked|in_flight|completed|blocked", "ts": "...", "owned_paths": [...], "subagent": "...", "notes": "..."}
```

`next_slice_researcher` must read the log before picking so in-flight or completed slices are not re-picked. The log is gitignored and ephemeral; one line per state transition is enough.

## Task template

For each delegated task, specify:

- exact outcome
- files or directories owned (disjoint from other in-flight slices)
- surfaces not to touch
- validation or tests to run if editing code
- report back: changed files, evidence gathered, unresolved risks, assumptions

Bounded deliverables only — no vague goals like "figure it out". Tell each subagent it is not alone in the codebase and must not revert others' edits.

## Preferred fan-out pattern

1. Read the relevant docs and classify the change (`$change-gate` if shared-interface risk).
2. If the real question is what to do next, delegate slice selection to `next_slice_researcher`.
3. If the slice is broad or underspecified, delegate decomposition to `task_designer`.
4. Spawn parallel implementation or documentation subagents only after ownership boundaries are explicit, and append to the slice log. Use the smallest number of agents that materially advances the task; parallelize aggressively once boundaries are clear.
5. Use `docs_writer` for doc and task-writeup changes.
6. Use `verification_reviewer` for cross-slice checking when risk is high or multiple workers edited adjacent surfaces.
7. Steer live agents: answer blockers, redirect unclear work, request tighter follow-up. Close agents when their work is integrated.
8. Synthesize results for the user without taking over implementation.

## Final response

- Summarize which subagents were used and what each produced.
- Distinguish subagent results from your own synthesis.
- Call out conflicts, unresolved risks, missing validation, and places where user direction is needed.
