Use whenever the user asks to keep going, continue implementation, pick the next work, suggest the next slice, continue phased development, or just keep shipping. Runs $orchestrate in continuation mode as a parallel scheduler — refilling an in-flight queue from next_slice_researcher, pipelining design stages, and committing after each completed slice until blocked or redirected.

# Phased Continuation

Continuation-mode wrapper for `$orchestrate`. Use when the user wants steady forward progress without re-specifying the next task.

Apply `$orchestrate` with the extras below. Do not drift into direct implementation because the next slice looks obvious. Do not fall back to serial execution because the scheduler shape is new — the loop is designed around concurrent work and only degrades to a single slice when research genuinely finds nothing else viable.

## Scheduler loop

Maintain two things across the loop:

- an **in-flight queue** — slices whose workers are dispatched but not yet complete
- a **pending pool** — slices returned by the most recent `next_slice_researcher` pass that have not yet been dispatched

On every iteration:

1. Read `.agents/state/slices.jsonl` so in-flight and completed slices are visible.
2. If both the in-flight queue and the pending pool are empty, spawn `next_slice_researcher` to refill the pool. Pass the log contents so it does not re-pick live work. Expect 2–4 envelopes back.
3. For every envelope in the pending pool that is not yet classified, fire `$change-gate` and `task_designer` in parallel (both read-only — do not serialize them). Log each slice as `picked`.
4. Drain the pending pool into the in-flight queue by dispatching waves from `task_designer` output up to `max_threads=10` concurrent workers across the whole in-flight set. Log each dispatched slice as `in_flight`.
5. As soon as workers are dispatched, if the pending pool is empty, spawn `next_slice_researcher` again for cycle N+1 so research runs concurrently with execution. Do not wait for workers to finish before re-researching.
6. When any slice completes, commit it (see below), log it `completed`, and return to step 4 — refill the in-flight queue from the pending pool or from fresh research.

Research, design, dispatch, and commit are the orchestrator's work. Implementation is the workers'.

## Commit after each completed slice

After each slice reaches its success signal, the orchestrator commits directly — do not batch multiple slices into one commit, and do not defer commits to a later cycle:

- `git add` the slice's `owned_paths` plus any docs the slice touched.
- `git commit -m` with a subject that references the `slice_id` and a one-line description of the capability that shipped. Follow the repo's existing commit style from `git log`.
- One commit per completed slice — the log stays bisection-friendly and `next_slice_researcher` gets clean ground truth on what has shipped.
- Do not push; pushing stays a user action.

`git add` and `git commit` are auto-approved for the orchestrator via `.codex/rules/default.rules`. Any other git command still requires approval.

## Do not decide the next slice locally

If `next_slice_researcher` can answer "what's next", let it. The loop exists so research runs concurrently with execution — there is no speed advantage to shortcutting it, and the researcher's access to `slices.jsonl` keeps picks coherent across cycles.

## Stop conditions

Stop and report when:

- the repo is blocked by unresolved semantics or shared-interface work and no unblocker slice exists
- a prerequisite slice is missing and should become the real next slice (blocked envelope in the pool)
- `next_slice_researcher` returns an empty list twice in a row
- the user interrupts or redirects
- the current phase exit criteria are satisfied and the next milestone needs explicit user confirmation
