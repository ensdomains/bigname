# bigname

bigname is a versioned indexing and read API for ENS, ENSv2, and Basenames. The checked-in docs are the source of truth for semantics; the implementation pipeline reference lives under `docs/internal/`.

## Guardrails

- Public-contract docs that constrain agent work: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-v1.md` (plus `docs/api-v1-routes.md`), `docs/storage.md`, `docs/manifests.md`, `docs/consumer-capabilities.md`.
- If a task changes public semantics, shared IDs or enums, coverage meaning, manifest schema, workstream ownership, or replacement meaning, update the relevant docs first or in the same change.
- Prefer cohesive end-to-end slices — a full capability with its tests and wiring, not a commit-sized edge. Do not build disguised legacy API parity or new planning docs unless semantics changed.
- bigname has no ADR folder. Architectural decisions are recorded directly in the relevant `docs/*.md`, in `docs/upstream.md` § Known divergences for upstream-related divergences, and in commit/PR history.

## Boundaries

- Adapters write identity rows and normalized events, not projection rows.
- API code reads projections and execution output only, except explicit audit endpoints.
- Execution code uses declared topology and manifests, not adapter internals.
- Manifest and discovery code decides what is authoritative.
- Raw facts are immutable. Projections are rebuildable. Canonicality is explicit. Execution artifacts are durable. Unsupported behavior must be explicit.

## Upstream anchors

The canonical ENSv1, ENSv2, and Basenames codebases are pinned under `.refs/`. Agents read from the pinned checkouts; they do not guess or paraphrase upstream behavior from memory.

- `.refs/ens_v1/` — canonical ENSv1 Solidity
- `.refs/ens_v2/` — ENSv2 contracts
- `.refs/basenames/` — canonical Basenames Solidity
- `.refs/ens_subgraph/`, `.refs/ensnode/` — reference indexers for cross-check only
- `.refs/ens_app_v3/` — ENS app known-resolver metadata for first-party app admission rows only

Pins live in `.refs/MANIFEST.toml`. Sync with `scripts/sync-refs`; verify with `scripts/sync-refs --check`. Rotation policy and known divergences live in `docs/upstream.md`.

Citation rules:

- Any claim about ENSv1, ENSv2, or Basenames behavior — in docs, manifests, ADRs, code comments, task writeups, or agent output — must cite the upstream source as `(upstream: .refs/<key>/<path>:L<line> @ <key>@<short-commit>)`.
- "Upstream says X" without a `.refs/` citation is unsupported and should be rejected in review.
- When upstream disagrees with our docs or manifests, the disagreement is a doc-first task. We may intentionally narrow, widen, or reshape upstream semantics; the divergence must be stated explicitly in the doc that carries our rule and listed in `docs/upstream.md` § Known divergences.
- Manifest address changes and new source families cite the upstream deployment metadata or Solidity file rather than relying on external URLs.

## High Conflict

- Keep `crates/domain` narrow.
- Coordinate migrations carefully.
- Treat fixture updates as cross-workstream review points.

## Rust File Size

- Hand-written production `.rs` files normally target <=500 LOC.
- The script emits advisory warnings for hand-written production files >500 LOC.
- Hand-written production files >600 LOC require an explicit entry in `scripts/rust-file-size-baseline.toml`; the file is now an oversized-file allowlist, not a full production-file ratchet list.
- Every allowlist entry must match the current file size and include a justification. Entries >900 LOC also require explicit review justification.
- Newly allowlisted hand-written production files may not exceed 1200 LOC. Existing allowlist allowances may not increase over the base allowance.
- Remove allowlist entries once files shrink to <=600 LOC. Omitting a base entry is OK only when the current file is no longer oversized.
- Generated code, bindings, typegen, constants, fixtures, tests, and equivalent non-production files remain excluded from the gate.
- `lib.rs` and `main.rs` are wiring files: target <=300 LOC, with hard review and an allowlist entry required above 500 LOC.
- The CI/script gate lives in `scripts/check-rust-file-size`.

## Core Skills

- `$change-gate`: classify doc-first vs implementation-only work.
- `$orchestrate`: make the current session orchestrate broad execution work, using subagents instead of doing most implementation directly. Covers fan-out and continuation as modes.
- `$phased-continuation`: run `$orchestrate` in continuation mode, cycling `next_slice_researcher` → execute → research until blocked or redirected.

## Core Agents

- `docs_writer`, `next_slice_researcher`, `task_designer`, `verification_reviewer`: defined in `.codex/agents/`. All four read `AGENTS.md` and treat upstream anchors as part of their reading set.
- `upstream_auditor`: read-only agent that surfaces drift between `.refs/` pins and upstream `main`. Run opportunistically or on a schedule; it reports, it does not bump pins.
