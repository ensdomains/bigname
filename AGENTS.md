# bigname

bigname is a versioned indexing and read API for ENS, ENSv2, and Basenames. The checked-in docs are the source of truth for semantics; agent process stays in this file and the repo-local skills.

## Guardrails

- Public-contract docs that constrain agent work: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-v1.md` (plus `docs/api-v1-routes.md`), `docs/storage.md`, `docs/manifests.md`, `docs/consumer-capabilities.md`, `docs/adrs/0001-stack.md`, `docs/adrs/0002-surface-resource-identity.md`.
- If a task changes public semantics, shared IDs or enums, coverage meaning, manifest schema, workstream ownership, or replacement meaning, update the relevant docs first or in the same change.
- Prefer cohesive end-to-end slices — a full capability with its tests and wiring, not a commit-sized edge. Do not build disguised legacy API parity or new planning docs unless semantics changed.

## Communication

- In docs, code comments, reviews, task writeups, plans, and agent output, describe the system in language that an engineer familiar with ENS and the project's stated scope can understand without first learning bigname-specific terminology.
- Prefer standard ENS, Ethereum, and indexing terms over project-specific jargon. When a bigname-specific term is necessary, define it in plain language on first use and explain the behavior it represents.
- `docs/glossary.md` is the canonical definition for each necessary bigname-specific term: link it on first use instead of re-defining or assuming the term, and add new coinages there in the same change that introduces them. Qualify the overloaded terms it flags (bare "promotion" and "profile" are ambiguous).

## Boundaries

- Adapters write identity rows and normalized events, not projection rows.
- API code reads projections and execution output only, except explicit audit endpoints and documented on-demand verified-resolution cache-miss writes through execution persistence.
- Execution code uses declared topology and manifests, not adapter internals.
- Manifest and discovery code decides what is authoritative.
- Raw facts are immutable. Projections are rebuildable. Canonicality is explicit. Execution artifacts are durable. Unsupported behavior must be explicit.

## Upstream anchors

The canonical ENSv1, ENSv2, and Basenames codebases are pinned under `.refs/`. Agents read from the pinned checkouts; they do not guess or paraphrase upstream behavior from memory.

- `.refs/ens_v1/` — canonical ENSv1 Solidity
- `.refs/ens_v2/` — canonical post-audit ENSv2 contracts and current Sepolia deployment
- `.refs/ens_v2_sepolia_dev/` — historical evidence for deprecated pre-audit `sepolia-dev` manifest versions only
- `.refs/basenames/` — canonical Basenames Solidity
- `.refs/ens_subgraph/`, `.refs/ensnode/` — reference indexers for cross-check only
- `.refs/ens_app_v3/` — ENS app known-resolver metadata for first-party app admission rows only
- `.refs/ponder/`, `.refs/graph_node/` — reference indexers for chain-intake cross-check only
- `.refs/reth/` — reference Ethereum execution client for node-level chain-intake cross-check only

Pins live in `.refs/MANIFEST.toml`. Sync with `scripts/sync-refs`; verify with `scripts/sync-refs --check`. Rotation policy and known divergences live in `docs/upstream.md`.

Citation rules:

- Any claim about ENSv1, ENSv2, Basenames, admitted upstream app metadata, reference-indexer comparison, or reference execution-client comparison behavior — in docs, manifests, ADRs, code comments, task writeups, or agent output — must cite the upstream source as `(upstream: .refs/<key>/<path>:L<line> @ <key>@<short-commit>)`.
- "Upstream says X" without a `.refs/` citation is unsupported and should be rejected in review.
- When upstream disagrees with our docs or manifests, the disagreement is a doc-first task. We may intentionally narrow, widen, or reshape upstream semantics; the divergence must be stated explicitly in the doc that carries our rule and listed in `docs/upstream.md` § Known divergences.
- Manifest address changes and new source families cite the upstream deployment metadata or Solidity file rather than relying on external URLs.

## High Conflict

- Keep `crates/domain` narrow.
- Coordinate migrations carefully.
- Treat fixture updates as cross-workstream review points.
- Inspect dirty state before staging. Stage explicit paths only, and never stage unrelated user or agent work.

## Rust File Size

- Hand-written production `.rs` files normally target <=500 LOC.
- The script emits advisory warnings for hand-written production files >500 LOC.
- Hand-written production files >600 LOC require an explicit entry in `scripts/rust-file-size-baseline.toml`; the file is now an oversized-file allowlist, not a full production-file ratchet list.
- Every allowlist entry must match the current file size and include a justification. Entries >900 LOC also require explicit review justification.
- Newly allowlisted hand-written production files may not exceed 1200 LOC. Existing allowlist allowances may not increase over the base allowance.
- Remove allowlist entries once files shrink to <=600 LOC. Omitting a base entry is OK only when the current file is no longer oversized.
- Generated code, bindings, typegen, constants, fixtures, tests, and equivalent non-production files remain excluded from the gate.
- `lib.rs` and `main.rs` are wiring files: target <=300 LOC, with hard review and an allowlist entry required above 500 LOC.
- The CI/script gate lives in `scripts/check-rust-file-size`.

## Core Skills

- `$contract-impact`: classify implementation-only vs doc-first/shared-interface work before coding.
- `$upstream-evidence`: gather pinned `.refs/` citations and divergence notes for upstream behavior claims.
- `$consumer-slice`: scope one end-to-end consumer capability with docs, behavior, tests, and explicit deferrals.
- `$manifest-authority`: plan or review manifests, discovery, admission, capability flags, and watch-plan authority.
- `$replay-safety`: review raw facts, normalized events, canonicality, projection rebuilds, invalidation, execution artifacts, and migrations.
- `$verify-loop`: user-invoked reviewer/fix loop that spawns a fresh `verification_reviewer`, confirms real findings with failing tests or checks, fixes them, and repeats until clean.

## Core Agents

- `evidence_reader`, `contract_editor`, `slice_builder`, and `verification_reviewer` are defined in `.codex/agents/`.
- Use subagents only for bounded work with a clear output contract. Do not run autonomous "keep shipping" loops without a named capability target and review gate.
