# bigname

`bigname` is in bootstrap. The checked-in docs are the source of truth for semantics.

## Guardrails

- Minimum shared-interface freeze: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-v1.md`, `docs/storage.md`, `docs/manifests.md`, `docs/consumer-capabilities.md`, `docs/adrs/0001-stack.md`, and `docs/adrs/0002-surface-resource-identity.md`.
- If a task changes public semantics, shared IDs or enums, coverage meaning, manifest schema, workstream ownership, or consumer-replacement meaning, update the relevant docs first or in the same change.
- Prefer cohesive end-to-end slices — a full capability with its tests and wiring, not a commit-sized edge. Do not build disguised legacy API parity or new planning docs unless semantics changed.

## Boundaries

- Adapters write identity rows and normalized events, not projection rows.
- API code reads projections and execution output only, except explicit audit endpoints.
- Execution code uses declared topology and manifests, not adapter internals.
- Manifest and discovery code decides what is authoritative.
- Raw facts are immutable. Projections are rebuildable. Canonicality is explicit. Execution artifacts are durable. Unsupported behavior must be explicit.

## Upstream anchors

The canonical ENSv1, ENSv2, and Basenames codebases are pinned under `.refs/`. Agents read from the pinned checkouts; they do not guess or paraphrase upstream behavior from memory.

- `.refs/ens_v1/` — canonical ENSv1 Solidity
- `.refs/ens_v2/` — ENSv2 contracts
- `.refs/basenames/` — canonical Basenames Solidity
- `.refs/ens_subgraph/`, `.refs/ensnode/` — reference indexers for cross-check only

Pins live in `.refs/MANIFEST.toml`. Sync with `scripts/sync-refs`; verify with `scripts/sync-refs --check`. Rotation policy and known divergences live in `docs/upstream.md`.

Citation rules:

- Any claim about ENSv1, ENSv2, or Basenames behavior — in docs, manifests, ADRs, code comments, task writeups, or agent output — must cite the upstream source as `(upstream: .refs/<key>/<path>:L<line> @ <key>@<short-commit>)`.
- "Upstream says X" without a `.refs/` citation is unsupported and should be rejected in review.
- When upstream disagrees with our docs or manifests, the disagreement is a doc-first task. We may intentionally narrow, widen, or reshape upstream semantics; the divergence must be stated explicitly in the doc that carries our rule and listed in `docs/upstream.md` § Known divergences.
- Manifest address changes and new source families cite the upstream deployment metadata or Solidity file rather than relying on external URLs.

## High Conflict

- Keep `crates/domain` narrow.
- Coordinate migrations carefully.
- Treat fixture updates as cross-workstream review points.

## Rust File Size

- Hand-written production `.rs` files normally target <=500 LOC.
- Phase 0 warns for files >600 LOC; later phases may harden this into a required allowlist entry.
- Baseline entries must match the current file size so shrinkage ratchets down in the same change.
- Files >900 LOC require explicit baseline justification.
- Files >1200 LOC are blocked for new hand-written production files unless they are generated code, bindings, typegen, constants, fixtures, or equivalent exceptions.
- `lib.rs` and `main.rs` are wiring files: target <=300 LOC, with hard review at >500 LOC.
- Existing legacy offenders are ratcheted down until the allowlist is empty or contains only true exceptions.
- The CI/script gate lives in `scripts/check-rust-file-size`.

## Core Skills

- `$change-gate`: classify doc-first vs implementation-only work.
- `$orchestrate`: make the current session orchestrate broad execution work, using subagents instead of doing most implementation directly. Covers fan-out and continuation as modes.
- `$phased-continuation`: run `$orchestrate` in continuation mode, cycling `next_slice_researcher` → execute → research until blocked or redirected.

## Core Agents

- `docs_writer`, `next_slice_researcher`, `task_designer`, `verification_reviewer`: defined in `.codex/agents/`. All four read `AGENTS.md` and treat upstream anchors as part of their reading set.
- `upstream_auditor`: read-only agent that surfaces drift between `.refs/` pins and upstream `main`. Run opportunistically or on a schedule; it reports, it does not bump pins.
