# Storage

Persistence boundaries for raw facts, identity, normalized events, projections, and execution. Architecture model in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md); intake detail in [`chain-intake.md`](chain-intake.md); manifest schema in [`manifests.md`](manifests.md); read model in [`projections.md`](projections.md); execution layout in [`execution.md`](execution.md).

## Invariants

- Durable raw facts are immutable. Evictable payload-cache entries and non-audit raw-log staging rows lose their system-of-record status once the replay contract that retained them is satisfied.
- Projections are disposable and rebuildable from canonical raw facts plus normalized events.
- Canonicality is explicit, never inferred from "latest row wins."
- Execution traces and steps are durable audit artifacts; cache outcomes are reusable only while their dependencies remain canonical.
- One write owner per storage family.

## Storage layers

The system of record splits into six layers.

1. `chain_lineage` — block ancestry, fork points, hash-first reconciliation, head promotion, one durable header-anchor row per observed block hash.
2. `raw_facts` — hot indexed replay facts: selected/admitted target logs, the minimum transaction/receipt fields needed to decode them, code-hash observations, fetched call snapshots, optional header/log audit extensions, compact payload-cache metadata.
3. `manifests_and_discovery` — source manifests, discovered edges, rollout flags.
4. `identity_and_events` — `NameSurface`, `SurfaceBinding`, `resources`, `token_lineages`, and append-only `normalized_events`.
5. `projections` — current-state and collection read models.
6. `execution` — durable traces and steps, `execution_cache_outcomes`, invalidation records.

Layers 1–5 rebuild current declared state. Layer 6 replays verified answers and explains them.

Worker-owned manifest/proxy alert observations live alongside these layers as an operational audit family. They record drift findings; they are not manifest truth, discovery admission, projection state, or adapter-owned events.

## Storage substrates

Postgres is the hot indexed and replay-focused store. It retains:

- lineage and header anchors needed to reconcile forks, prove ancestry, promote checkpoints, audit canonicality
- selected/admitted target logs and the minimal transaction and receipt fields while they are needed to decode those logs, route them through adapters, and append normalized events
- block-scoped call snapshots and enrichments retained by an explicit replay contract for normalized events, projections, or execution artifacts
- code-hash observations and discovery/proxy evidence used by manifests, adapter routing, and audit tooling
- compact metadata and optional digests for full payloads fetched as cache

Hash-addressed object storage holds large execution payloads (CCIP bodies, large metadata responses, trace attachments) keyed by SHA-256 digest. Postgres records the digest, size, content type, and object key; the bytes live in object storage.

Hash-addressed object storage is a durability boundary only for raw payload classes a doc-first policy explicitly declares durable. For everything else it is implementation detail for evictable cache.

## Raw-log retention modes

`raw_logs`, selected `raw_transactions`, and selected `raw_receipts` have two retention modes selected operationally:

- **minimal** — these rows are adapter-replay staging. They may be compacted after the normalized replay cursor advances past the retained block range and the corresponding `normalized_events`, identity rows, lineage rows, and projection rebuild inputs are durable.
- **log-audit** — the same rows remain durable audit facts and may keep heavier indexes for historical raw-fact replay.

Switching modes is operational policy. It does not change route coverage, projection truth, canonicality semantics, manifest rollout, or consumer-replacement meaning.

`bigname-worker raw-facts compact-log-staging` is the manual compaction boundary for minimal mode. It refuses to compact unless the `raw_fact_normalized_events` replay cursor is caught up and failure-free, and only operates on raw-log staging families. Log-audit deployments do not run it for retained ranges.

After compaction, `chain_lineage` and any retained compact block-anchor metadata remain the block-hash path for losing-branch repair, and `normalized_events` carry the block identity, source identity, event identity, and provenance needed by projection rebuilds and history reads. If raw-log staging rows are already gone, reorg repair marks normalized events and identity rows orphaned from lineage and updates zero raw-log rows for that range. Historical adapter replay from compacted ranges is an explicit backfill/refetch operation against the configured provider/cache substrate or requires log-audit retention; it is not an implicit API fallback.

Compaction and pruning must stay behind the rewind horizon they serve. Minimal mode may drop staging rows after replay is durable, but it must not drop lineage, normalized-event provenance, identity intervals, projection change records, or retained replay facts needed to orphan a losing branch and rebuild the canonical snapshot. If a compacted range later needs adapter-level byte replay and no retained digest-checked payload or provider/cache fill can satisfy it, that repair fails closed rather than inventing state from current projections.

## Evictable payload cache

Large/full block payloads, non-indexed transaction/receipt/block bodies, and non-audit raw-log staging rows are evictable cache by default once the selected replay contract has been satisfied. They may live inline during a hot window, in local/provider cache, in hash-addressed object storage, or not be retained at all.

Retained cache metadata describes what was fetched: payload kind, chain id, block hash/number where block-scoped, optional digest, size, content type or encoding, source observation metadata, observed time, canonicality state. A retained digest authorizes later byte use; metadata without one cannot.

Provider re-fetch is an explicit, fallible cache-fill path. For block-scoped payloads it is block-hash-scoped, verifies the retained digest before any bytes are used, and fails closed when the digest is absent, the digest mismatches, or the provider cannot serve the exact historical payload. It is not a substitute for retained lineage, normalized events, execution artifacts, or orphaned-branch audit truth.

Local execution-client storage (e.g. a same-host Reth database) is provider/cache substrate, not a new storage family. Client table keys, row cursors, static-file offsets, and data-directory paths appear only in operational source metadata or evictable cache metadata — never as durable `raw_fact_ref` identities, normalized-event provenance, or projection inputs.

Historical backfill does not turn empty blocks into hot payload archives. A block with no selected target logs and no replay-required enrichment retains lineage/header anchors and any compact audit metadata required by the selected retention policy. Full block bodies, receipt bundles, transaction bundles, and payload-cache bytes for those empty historical blocks remain evictable or absent.

## Identity strategy

### Deterministic text IDs

`logical_name_id = "<namespace>:<normalized_name>"` — stable, human-auditable, derivable without database lookup.

`normalized_name` is the output of the single ENSIP-15 normalizer declared as `ensip15@ens-normalize-0.1.1`; storage validation and projection inputs must not substitute IDNA/UTS-46 conversion, ASCII lowercasing, or trimming. Name-surface DNS wire names, namehashes, and labelhash paths are derived from the same normalized labels. `primary_names_current` treats blank or whitespace-only reverse-claim source values as absent claims; nonblank claim-name sources either normalize through ENSIP-15 or remain verbatim as `raw_claim_name` for `invalid_name`.

ENSv1 name-surface materialization does not admit embedded NUL bytes in registrar labels, wrapper DNS labels, or resolver `name` record preimages. Those observations may still remain as raw facts and, where applicable, resolver-record normalized events, but they do not mint or update `NameSurface` rows or label preimage state. This keeps displayable name identity distinct from literal onchain strings that reference indexers also treat as invalid or unnormalizable for label/name interpretation.[^ens-subgraph-label-null][^ens-subgraph-name-null][^ensnode-null-label]

### Opaque UUIDs

- `resource_id`
- `token_lineage_id`
- `contract_instance_id`
- `surface_binding_id`
- `execution_trace_id`

UUID values are internal identities, not user-generated strings. `resource_id` and `token_lineage_id` survive projection rebuilds. Token IDs, node hashes, and resolver addresses are attributes, not identity anchors.

### Append-only event IDs

`bigint generated always as identity` for raw fact rows, normalized event rows, and projection job rows.

### Continuity rules

`logical_name_id`, `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, and `contract_instance_id` continuity is shared with [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — see the identity model section there for the rules adapters must follow when minting and reusing IDs across ENSv1 wrap/unwrap/re-registration, ENSv2 token regeneration, and proxy implementation churn.

The storage-side guarantees those rules depend on:

- One admitted contract address on one chain maps to one stable `contract_instance_id` across all admission epochs. Re-admission after an inactive gap reuses the prior id and records a new non-overlapping active range.
- Proxy contracts and their implementations are separate `contract_instance_id`s. Implementation churn updates the proxy/implementation discovery edge, not the proxy id.
- Contract addresses are time-ranged attributes for raw-fact lookup, log routing, and watch-plan materialization. Addresses are never the primary key of the source graph.
- Stable adapter identity rows for `token_lineages`, `resources`, and `name_surfaces` are idempotent across retained replay anchors. Replaying a compatible row with the same stable identity and identity-defining fields from a later raw-log anchor may be accepted as an existing identity without rewriting the original anchor, anchor provenance, or `observed_at`; incompatible identity fields remain hard conflicts, and orphaned rows may be replaced through the normal reorg-replay path. For `name_surfaces`, the compatibility key is the stable logical id plus namespace, normalized name, DNS wire name, namehash, labelhash path, and normalization errors; input spelling, display spelling, normalizer version, and warnings are retained observation metadata and may differ across compatible replay observations. For token/resource identities, provenance describes the retained observation anchor and is not itself a later-anchor compatibility key.
- Normalizer-version repair follows the same split. The indexer repair command may update retained `name_surfaces` observation metadata when the current normalizer produces the same logical id, normalized name, DNS wire name, namehash, labelhash path, and empty normalization errors; retained chain/block/provenance/`observed_at` anchors are preserved. Rows that reject or remap under the current normalizer are not silently rewritten; they are recorded in `name_surface_normalization_repair_findings` for semantic review before any future orphan/remap repair.
- For interval identity rows like `surface_bindings`, `active_from` and the stable identity anchors are immutable; `active_to` is replay-derived. Canonical historical replay may tighten an existing non-null `active_to` to an earlier close point when older or more complete facts reveal an earlier end. It does not extend or reopen a closed interval. Replay batches that both close an existing interval and open a replacement at the same boundary apply the existing interval update before inserting the replacement, so the non-overlap invariant is enforced without relying on implicit snapshots.

For ENSv2, `resource_id` keys by `(chain_id, registry_contract_instance_id, upstream_eac_resource)` after observing the upstream EAC resource — not by the current ERC-1155 token id. Upstream exposes both `getResource(anyId)` and `getTokenId(anyId)`, emits `TokenResource(tokenId, resource)` when a token links to a resource, and emits `TokenRegenerated(oldTokenId, newTokenId)` when role changes burn and mint a replacement token while leaving the resource unchanged.[^v2-iperm-l34][^v2-iperm-l67][^v2-iperm-l72][^v2-events-l69][^v2-pr-l216][^v2-pr-l451] Unregister/re-register increments both `eacVersionId` and `tokenVersionId` and mints fresh `resource_id` and `token_lineage_id`.[^v2-pr-l28][^v2-pr-l203][^v2-pr-l237][^v2-pr-l536]

## Table families and write ownership

| Family | Write owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chain_*` | intake | lineage and canonical block graph |
| `raw_*` | intake | immutable hot replay facts and payload-cache metadata |
| `backfill_*` | worker/backfill substrate | persisted backfill jobs, bounded range leases, resumable range checkpoints |
| `normalized_replay_*` | indexer/replay orchestration | operational replay cursors and adapter-private replay checkpoints |
| `manifest_*` | manifests/discovery | source manifests, declared contract admission, capability versions |
| `discovery_*` | manifests/discovery | canonical reachable contract graph, watch-plan expansion keyed by `contract_instance_id` |
| `manifest_alert_*` | worker/audit | persisted manifest-drift and proxy-alert observations |
| `name_surfaces`, `surface_bindings`, `resources`, `token_lineages` | adapters | stable identity anchors |
| `name_surface_normalization_repair_findings` | indexer repair | audit table for retained name-surface rows that reject or remap under the active normalizer and therefore need explicit semantic follow-up rather than silent metadata rewrite |
| `normalized_events` | adapters | append-only normalized protocol events |
| `projection_*` | projection workers | disposable read models |
| `address_names_current_identity_counts`, `address_names_current_identity_feed` | storage triggers on `address_names_current`, `primary_names_current`, and supporting identity-anchor and `name_current` readability changes | exact reverse identity total counts and compact feed display rows by address, role filter, and primary-name coin type for the partner-compatible identity façade, using the same canonical/read-safe and reachable-`name_current` row eligibility as reverse identity pages; this is the bounded exception in [`adrs/0005-identity-count-sidecar.md`](adrs/0005-identity-count-sidecar.md) |
| `current_projection_replay_status` | projection workers | durable operational completion markers for bootstrap/full all-current projection replay |
| `projection_normalized_event_changes` | normalized-event storage trigger; projection workers consume | append-only downstream change log for normalized-event inserts and canonicality-state updates |
| `projection_apply_cursors`, `projection_invalidations` | projection workers | durable projection apply watermarks and key-scoped projection invalidation queue |
| `execution_*` | execution workers; synchronous indexer/reorg repair for orphan-block cache outcome deletes only | durable traces and steps, normal `execution_cache_outcomes` writes, invalidation records |

The API process is read-only against storage.

Within `execution_*`, the only non-execution-worker write owner is synchronous indexer/reorg repair during chain reconciliation. That path may delete or invalidate reusable `execution_cache_outcomes` rows whose dependency set includes an orphaned block identity. It does not write traces, steps, normal outcomes, projections, API state, or manifest state.

For interval identity and normalized authority/permission events, adapters mint and reuse `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, and `surface_binding_id` per the architecture identity rules. Projection workers consume those rows; they do not infer alternate continuity or synthesize cross-resource permission carry.

## Manifests and discovery persistence

At minimum:

- `contract_instances` — one row per stable `contract_instance_id` with chain, contract kind, and provenance. Roots use the same identity family as other contract instances.
- `contract_instance_addresses` — time-ranged address attributes keyed by `contract_instance_id`. One id may carry multiple non-overlapping active ranges. Manifest-declared address ranges may carry nullable inclusive `start_block` metadata where the manifest supplied it.
- `discovery_edges` — keyed by `edge_id` with `from_contract_instance_id`, `to_contract_instance_id`, `edge_kind`, active range, provenance, canonicality.
- Materialized watch-plan rows keyed by `contract_instance_id` plus chain and range; root start nodes keyed by the root `contract_instance_id`. Address is a derived watch target, not the durable identity. An omitted `start_block` is persisted as null rather than coerced to zero.

Resolver-profile admission state (PublicResolver-generation profiles for ENSv1, `L2Resolver` compatibility for Basenames) is gated separately from contract-instance admission. It may be derived from existing discovery provenance, normalized resolver-discovery events, manifest contract roles, code-hash facts, and proxy/implementation edges; a dedicated profile-fact table is not required. Profile admission gates complete-family, resolver-overview, latest-only, authorization, and onchain-call parity claims for the affected resolver instance — not baseline generic resolver-event observation.[^v1-pres-l20][^v1-pres-l66][^bn-l2resolver-l4][^bn-l2resolver-l16][^bn-l2resolver-l29]

`manifest_alert_*` carries an observation identity, observation kind (`manifest_drift` or `proxy_implementation_drift`), lifecycle status, manifest version, source family, chain, contract-instance references, nullable proxy/implementation edge references, expected and observed code-hash or implementation-edge material, derived watch-plan metadata, first/last observed timestamps, and nullable remediation metadata. Writing it does not write `normalized_events`, mutate manifest truth, mutate discovery admission, change capability flags, or expose API state. A proxy implementation observation preserves the proxy `contract_instance_id`; implementation churn is represented by an observed or admitted edge, not by minting a replacement proxy identity.

## Backfill persistence

At minimum:

- `backfill_jobs` — one row per bounded backfill job with selected profile, chain, selector kind, resolved source identity, scan mode, declared range start and end, idempotency key, lifecycle status, failure metadata, timestamps.
- `backfill_ranges` — child range records with declared range bounds, last-completed checkpoint, lease owner, lease token, lease expiry, attempt counters, lifecycle status, failure metadata, timestamps. A new range initializes its checkpoint to one block before the declared start so resume starts at `checkpoint_block_number + 1`.
- Monotonic helper-owned checkpoint fields that let a worker resume after crash without widening the original range or reclassifying already admitted facts.

Operational finalized catch-up uses these same families. It may create many finite chunks, but each chunk preserves one immutable job shape and idempotency key. Capacity preflight (current Postgres size, writable free disk, configured object-cache budget) records explicit failure or paused state in existing lifecycle/failure metadata when capacity is insufficient.

The selector identity fields on a job:

- `selector_kind` — `whole_active_watched_chain`, `source_family`, or `watched_target_set`
- `source_family` — the requested family for `selector_kind=source_family`, otherwise null
- `requested_watched_targets` — caller-supplied watched targets for `selector_kind=watched_target_set`, otherwise empty
- `selected_targets` — the resolved materialized target set sorted by `source_family`, `contract_instance_id`, normalized address, effective from-block, effective to-block
- `source_identity_hash` — digest of `selector_kind`, `source_family`, `requested_watched_targets`, and `selected_targets`

Very large source-family jobs may persist compact selector identity instead of a full `selected_targets` array. Compact identity sets `source_identity_payload_format=selected_targets_digest_v1` and carries `selected_target_count`, `selected_targets_digest_algorithm`, `selected_targets_digest`, a first/last `selected_targets_sample`, and `source_identity_hash`. The digest input remains the sorted canonical `selected_targets` tuple.

Backfill idempotency is derived from deployment profile, chain, finite range, scan family, and source identity. It must not include the local manifest root path: moving the same selected manifest corpus between filesystem locations does not create new raw backfill work. Bootstrap checkpoint reuse follows the same rule by matching persisted source identity and contiguous range coverage rather than the literal idempotency-key text.

`effective_to_block` is finite for every persisted selected target — backfill jobs are finite at creation time. Bootstrap ranges start at each eligible target's manifest/discovery admitted start and end at the finite provider head observed at job creation. A watched target whose manifest-declared `start_block` is unknown is skipped by bootstrap; it leaves no synthetic block-zero, provider-history, recent-window, or job-start range in `backfill_*`.

### Backfill range checkpoint vs chain checkpoint

Backfill range checkpoints are operational state. They record only that bounded fetch/resume work reached a position in a declared range. They do not change any `canonicality_state` value and do not advance `canonical_head`, `safe_head`, or `finalized_head`.

Backfill raw admission still writes canonicality for the facts it admits. When the admitted historical range is already proven canonical, safe, or finalized by retained lineage or provider checkpoint evidence, new lineage, raw-fact, and normalized-event rows use `canonical`, `safe`, or `finalized` as appropriate rather than staying `observed` solely because the source was backfill. If the evidence is absent, the storage layer preserves the weaker state.

## Partitioning baseline

Partitioned tables:

- `chain_lineage`
- `chain_header_audit` (when auditable retention produces enough rows to justify it)
- `raw_transactions`
- `raw_receipts`
- `raw_logs`
- `normalized_events`
- `execution_steps`

Partition keys: `chain_id` and block-number range. Current-state projection tables start unpartitioned unless measurements prove otherwise.

## Canonicality model

`chain_lineage` persists the recent reconciled block window keyed by `(chain_id, block_hash)`:

- `parent_hash`
- `block_number`
- `timestamp`
- checkpoint-promotion state

Header audit fields are optional retention. The default lineage contract omits `logs_bloom`, `transactions_root`, `receipts_root`, and `state_root`; reorg repair walks backward through `(block_hash, parent_hash)` until it reaches a stored matching ancestor, then marks the losing stored branch and dependent facts noncanonical from that point forward.

An auditable-header retention mode stores those fields in `chain_header_audit` keyed by the same `(chain_id, block_hash)` so inspection tooling can explain or cross-check fetched payloads. Their absence cannot prevent canonicality repair, checkpoint promotion, replay over retained selected facts, or projection rebuilds. When both stored and incoming audit rows carry the same field, mismatches are hard storage conflicts.

`raw_blocks` is not a durable table. Intake, replay, workers, adapters, audit helpers, and tests read block timestamps and canonicality from `chain_lineage` and read optional audit roots/bloom from `chain_header_audit` when auditable retention is enabled. Normal replay batches block-anchor admission once through the `chain_lineage` write boundary.

Every fact-derived row that can be invalidated by reorg carries `chain_id`, `block_number`, `block_hash`, `canonicality_state`, `observed_at`. `canonicality_state` values:

- `observed`
- `canonical`
- `safe`
- `finalized`
- `orphaned`

Rules:

- block hash is the identity anchor; block number is position only
- fork detection marks affected rows `orphaned`; it does not delete them
- reorg repair preserves lineage and normalized-event/identity canonicality for losing branches as audit truth; log-audit mode also preserves selected raw-log/transaction/receipt facts. Minimal raw-log retention may already have compacted those staging rows
- evictable payload-cache bytes or compacted staging rows do not erase canonicality, normalized-event provenance, or replay-critical evidence retained by the selected policy
- optional header audit fields are verified when both stored and incoming audit rows carry them. A minimal replay does not conflict with an existing auditable row solely because it omitted those fields
- projection rebuilds read rows that are `canonical`, `safe`, or `finalized` by default; history and audit tools may opt into `observed` and `orphaned` rows
- safe and finalized promotion is monotonic per chain

## Reorg repair

Reorg repair preserves audit truth: orphaned rows persist for explanation and rebuild, not deletion. The losing branch's lineage, identity rows, and normalized events stay canonical-state `orphaned` so explain and history routes can still reconstruct what was observed.

Execution cache rows follow the same hash-first canonicality rule. When reorg repair marks a block identity `orphaned`, synchronous indexer/reorg repair invalidates or deletes any reusable `execution_cache_outcomes` row whose dependency set includes that `(chain_id, block_hash)` or a boundary resolved through it. The invalidation makes the cached outcome ineligible for reuse; it does not delete raw facts, traces, steps, attachments, or any execution-owned audit artifact.

Reusable `execution_cache_outcomes` rows carry dependencies tied to explicit block-hash-bearing chain positions or boundaries. Rows that lack those dependencies fail closed.

## Replay semantics

Raw-fact normalized-event replay is indexer-owned orchestration over the adapter-owned `normalized_events` boundary. It selects bounded canonical raw facts and asks adapters to perform an upsert-only resync; it advances only its own `normalized_replay_*` cursor.

Whole-range replay is the default. Automatic bootstrap and automatic catch-up share one all-source chain cursor over persisted canonical raw facts in block order — adapter-owned identity histories combine registry, registrar, wrapper, resolver, and reverse-claim signals into one storage write boundary, so independent per-source-family cursors would tear those histories.

Normalized events are adapter-owned semantic transition rows, not guaranteed-stateless decorations on individual raw logs. Some adapters can derive every emitted row from the selected raw fact alone; those stateless adapters may be replayed from a block-hash selection. Stateful adapters derive `before_state`, resource continuity, authority metadata, resolver state, wrapper state, registrar expiry, and permission provenance from the chronological adapter history. For those adapters, replay that emits or compares transition rows must start from a valid closure boundary and carry adapter state across every physical page in the replay.

The current valid closure boundary for a stateful adapter is the earliest retained canonical raw fact for that adapter/source graph. A later boundary is valid only after a documented, durable, versioned adapter-state snapshot exists for that boundary. Existing `normalized_events`, `surface_bindings`, `resources`, projection rows, or API-visible state are not semantic input for deterministic stateful replay and must not be used as implicit snapshots.

Full-closure replay may persist adapter-private checkpoints under `normalized_replay_adapter_checkpoints` and `normalized_replay_adapter_checkpoint_items`. These rows are replay orchestration state: they may contain staged adapter observations, scan watermarks, and versioned payloads needed to resume an in-progress closure pass, but they are not raw facts, manifest truth, identity rows, projection input, or API state. A checkpoint can make process restarts resumable only for the adapter and checkpoint payload version that wrote it. For `ens_v1_unwrapped_authority`, the durable checkpoint payload is the adapter's private closure snapshot: dirty name histories, reverse-claim histories, learned name metadata, pending namehash observations, migrated-registry markers, flushed normalized-event counters, and the block-boundary watermark. To keep closure replay bounded, the adapter may flush already-emitted normalized events through the adapter-owned `normalized_events` upsert boundary at checkpoint boundaries, then persist the checkpoint with those event buffers cleared. Those flushed rows are not projection readiness, public API readiness, identity-row finalization, or a cursor boundary; projection workers still wait for the global `raw_fact_normalized_events` cursor and identity finalization. If a process exits after a flush but before the matching checkpoint save, restart may replay and upsert the same event identities again, and any differing payload remains a hard storage mismatch. A completed snapshot may remain after cursor advancement so the next closure target can extend from that private adapter boundary. Transient adapter checkpoints may be cleared after a successful closure pass only when they are not declared durable snapshot boundaries. Full-closure replay chooses physical pages by canonical raw-log event candidate count while preserving whole-block boundaries; adapter routing may then filter that page down to the watched or generic source events that the closure pass consumes. Implementation scan guards may limit one database range probe, but they are throughput guards rather than semantic 512-block replay windows. If a single block exceeds the configured candidate-log cap, the full block is still replayed as one page; the cap is not allowed to split a block or create a replay cursor. When a scan guard is reached before the candidate-log cap, the page may advance through empty or low-density whole blocks because no semantic boundary is created until the closure target completes. The global `raw_fact_normalized_events` cursor advances only after the closure adapter finalizes its adapter-owned writes through the requested target block. Automatic full-closure catch-up latches that requested target when the cursor is created and does not widen the same closure pass just because newer live raw facts arrive while it is running or after it completes; a later closure target requires an explicit cursor rewind/reset or a documented adapter-state snapshot boundary. A completed automatic catch-up may be followed by a separate `post_replay_live_adapter_backlog` operational cursor that live-normalizes canonical raw-log blocks already persisted after the latched replay target before normal live polling resumes adapter sync. That cursor scopes adapter routing from the selected raw-log emitters, is not a closure replay cursor, does not change the full-closure target, and remains replay-safe because it uses the same deterministic adapter-owned upsert path as live polling. Source-scoped live and backlog discovery writes are bounded manifest/discovery mutations: they reconcile touched observation keys and the affected descendant branch only, while full-source discovery carry-forward remains a closure/full-reconciliation operation. ENSv2 registry/resource replay runs before ENSv2 registrar and resolver replay so contextual rows see stable registry/resource outputs; ENSv2 permissions replay then runs over the retained resolver-family raw-log history. These ENSv2 closure passes do not currently publish durable adapter-private snapshots, so a restart reruns the topologically ordered closure pass from the retained closure boundary and relies on idempotent normalized-event and identity upserts.

Contextual adapters are not stateful because of `before_state`; they are contextual because their emitted identity, row set, or payload depends on another adapter-owned identity/discovery output being stable. Empty `before_state` is not proof of stateless replay. Replay for these adapters is deterministic only after dependency closure is complete and stable, or inside a documented topologically ordered closure replay.

Batching is only a physical IO and throughput detail. Chunk size, log-count caps, whole-block replay pages, block-hash paging, process restarts, and cursor checkpoints do not create semantic replay boundaries for stateful or contextual adapters. If automatic replay cannot resume with a durable adapter snapshot, it restarts from the closure boundary. Source-scoped, per-target, and block-hash replay for a stateful or contextual adapter is operational repair only and fails closed unless the requested selection is proven closure-complete.

Current raw-fact normalized replay allows restricted block-hash/source-scoped replay only for adapters classified `stateless_raw_fact`. `stateful_closure_required` and `contextual_dependency_required` adapters fail closed for restricted replay unless the requested range starts at the retained closure boundary and the adapter has an implemented closure/dependency replay session. The central code contract is mirrored here:

| Adapter / producer | Model | Raw-fact restricted replay | Reason and proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block_derived_normalized_events` | `stateless_raw_fact` | Allowed | Preimage rows are decoded from selected canonical raw logs, manifest/source metadata, and decoder constants. Covered by idempotent normalized replay and block-derived adapter tests. |
| `ens_v1_reverse_claim` | `stateless_raw_fact` | Allowed | `ReverseChanged` rows are derived from the selected `ReverseClaimed` raw log and immutable manifest/source metadata. Covered by block-range, source-scoped, and block-hash replay tests. |
| `ens_v1_subregistry_discovery` | `contextual_dependency_required` | Restricted replay denied; full retained closure replay allowed | Normalized rows include discovery-edge contract-instance context; raw-log selection alone is not stable dependency closure. |
| `ens_v1_unwrapped_authority` | `stateful_closure_required` | Restricted replay denied; full retained closure replay allowed | Authority transitions, `before_state`, resource continuity, resolver state, wrapper state, registrar expiry, and permission provenance require one ordered in-memory history across registry, registrar, wrapper, resolver, and related Basenames families. |
| `ens_v2_registry_resource_surface` | `stateful_closure_required` | Restricted replay denied; full retained closure replay allowed | Token/resource identity, suffix state, bindings, discovery observations, and regeneration intervals depend on canonical ordered registry history through the replay target. |
| `ens_v2_registrar` | `contextual_dependency_required` | Restricted replay denied; full retained closure replay allowed | Registrar rows resolve `logical_name_id` and `resource_id` from stable ENSv2 registry/resource output replayed through the same target. |
| `ens_v2_resolver` | `contextual_dependency_required` | Restricted replay denied; full retained closure replay allowed | Resolver rows resolve name/resource links from stable `name_surfaces` and `surface_bindings` replayed through the same target. |
| `ens_v2_permissions` | `stateful_closure_required` | Restricted replay denied; full retained closure replay allowed | Permission resources and role events depend on prior resolver resource-hint observations in canonical order through the replay target. |
| `manifest_normalized_events` | `contextual_dependency_required` | Not a raw-fact replay participant | Manifest rows derive from manifest, capability, code-hash, and discovery-edge corpus state rather than selected raw logs. |

Source-scoped or per-target replay is an operational repair mode. It narrows the raw-log selection and adapter source scope; it does not narrow canonicality, change persisted backfill job identity, delete raw facts from other sources, mutate discovery or manifests, or graduate coverage. Storage helpers, projections, API code, and inspection tooling do not synthesize normalized events outside this boundary.

Replay reads canonical durable hot facts first. It may use a retained durable cold payload only when an explicitly retained replay contract requires that payload. For block-scoped payloads it may use provider re-fetch only through the digest-checked, fail-closed cache-fill path.

Adapter-private replay checkpoint payloads are resumability state, not canonical event payloads. They may use versioned, lossless encodings for strings that PostgreSQL `jsonb` cannot store directly, and adapters must decode those snapshots before continuing deterministic replay.

Replay does not delete stale `normalized_events` or replace existing payloads for an already persisted normalized-event identity. The upsert path inserts absent rows and refreshes canonicality for matching identities; conflicting payloads remain mismatches. Adapter-owned identity rows may be marked `orphaned` only when those rows have no backing normalized event, were produced by the same adapter boundary, and would otherwise overlap the incoming identity interval.

Replay does not mutate `chain_*`, `raw_*`, `backfill_*`, `projection_*`, `execution_*`, manifests, discovery rows, public API state, or checkpoint promotion state.

### Adapter repair

Explicit adapter repair is narrower than replay and exists for deterministic adapter bugs where the persisted normalized-event identity is correct but a small payload field was encoded lossily. It is bounded by existing `normalized_events` rows, matches the retained `(chain_id, block_hash, transaction_hash, log_index)` identity, decodes through adapter-owned logic, and updates only documented lossy fields. In minimal raw-log deployments, repair may fetch exact historical logs directly from the configured provider or same-host Reth substrate without re-materializing `raw_logs`.

The currently admitted repair is ENSv1 PublicResolver-compatible `TextChanged` payload repair: legacy generic `RecordChanged` rows with `record_family=text`, `record_key=text`, `selector_key=null` are rewritten to selector-specific `text:<key>` rows; selector-specific text rows missing a retained value have that value filled when the source log verifies against the indexed key hash.[^v1-text-l5][^v1-text-l21] Repair does not write `raw_*`, `backfill_*`, projections, manifests, discovery rows, execution rows, or public API state directly.

### Bulk-load index deferral

During fresh normalized replay — current projection tables empty, normalized replay cursor not at target — the indexer may defer normalized-event indexes that exist only for projection/API readback while keeping replay-required indexes for event identity, reverse-claim lookup, and latest resolver/version preloads. Deferred indexes are recreated before projection rebuilds or API-ready declared reads complete.

`current_projection_replay_status` rows let worker restarts resume from the first unfinished projection family instead of restarting bootstrap/full replay from the start. They are worker-owned operational progress: not API truth, not projection data, not live-readiness state, and ignored unless the recorded replay version is still current and the recorded normalized target covers the requested replay target.

`projection_invalidations` rows are the durable key-scoped work queue for projection refreshes. `projection_normalized_event_changes` is the append-only downstream input for normalized-event inserts and canonicality-state updates; migrations install the forward log and trigger without bulk-copying historical `normalized_events`. `projection_apply_cursors` rows track consumed `change_id` watermarks for that input. Manifest, execution, and other non-normalized-event invalidation producers write the same queue directly. The primary key is `(projection, projection_key)`; repeated invalidations for the same key update the row generation and release any stale claim so an older apply cannot erase newer work. Projection workers claim and apply rows in projection dependency order, then delete only the claimed generation. Claims are leases with retry recovery, so rows claimed by a stopped worker become eligible again after the retry delay rather than requiring manual queue repair.

## Projection storage rules

Every current-state projection row carries provenance pointers, manifest version, relevant chain positions, canonicality summary, and last-recomputed timestamp.

Projection tables may be truncated and rebuilt from canonical facts plus normalized events.

Historical projection materializations are projection-owned caches, not truth. When a worker materializes an `at` or `chain_positions` snapshot, the rows are keyed by the normal projection key plus exact chain-position context or an equivalent snapshot key. They may be bounded and evicted by policy; absence returns `stale`. A historical materialization must never overwrite a newer current row in place, and the API must never fill a missing historical projection from raw facts or provider data.

Exact-name snapshot selection is a storage read boundary, not a new family. The API resolves `at`, explicit `chain_positions`, and `consistency` to one concrete `ChainPositions` object, then reads only projection rows and execution outputs eligible for that exact object. `name_current`, `coverage_current`, `surface_bindings_current`, `permissions_current`, and `record_inventory_current` retain enough chain-position context for the API to reject mismatched joins rather than combine rows from different snapshots.

If the selected positions are valid but no eligible projection or persisted execution output exists, the serving path returns the documented `stale`, `unsupported`, or `not_found` API state. It does not read raw facts, adapter-owned identity/event rows, or provider data directly to fill the public response.

## Execution storage

Inline in Postgres for small payloads:

- request metadata
- response digests
- decoded final values
- failure reasons

In hash-addressed object storage, addressed by SHA-256 digest:

- CCIP payload bodies
- large metadata responses
- trace attachments

Postgres records the digest, size, content type, and object key for each attachment.

`execution_traces` and `execution_steps` preserve what was executed and why. Normal `execution_cache_outcomes` writes record whether a verified outcome can be reused under its request key, manifest versions, and block-hash-bearing dependency boundaries. The reorg-invalidation exception above is the only non-execution-worker write path.

Exact block-anchored `raw_call_snapshots` used by verified resolution stay in the intake-owned `raw_*` family. Execution may hand off candidate snapshots only through the raw-fact boundary, only for the exact requested chain position, and only for support classes that admit them. `execution_traces`, `execution_steps`, and `execution_cache_outcomes` do not own those rows.

Before a verified-resolution selector persists as a supported reusable outcome, execution reloads from storage the exact manifest versions for the request, the same declared topology snapshot a mixed route would serve, and any resolver-profile admission state required by participating resolver-local fact families. The frozen support class derives from those stored inputs and matches the persisted trace and cache key. If those inputs are absent or do not re-establish one frozen class, the trace remains a durable audit artifact but the selector does not persist as a supported reusable outcome.

## Read-only inspection tooling

Worker-owned, read-only operational tooling reads storage audit helpers and renders stable JSON. It does not create public `v1` routes, mutate state, fetch fresh chain data, or bypass API read boundaries.

- `bigname-worker inspect canonicality --chain-id <id> --block-hash <hash>` — for a stored block: lineage, parent hash, block number, canonicality state, optional header-audit presence, raw fact counts, payload-cache metadata counts/digests where retained, normalized-event counts.
- `bigname-worker inspect stored-lineage-range --chain-id <id> --from <block> --to <block>` — lists only lineage rows already stored for the requested chain and finite block range, ordered by `(block_number, block_hash)`. Renders chain id, block number, block hash, parent hash, canonicality state, timestamp, and stored promotion markers per observed block. Nullable fields render as `null`. Does not infer missing heights, gaps, span-wide canonicality, or completeness.
- `bigname-worker inspect backfill-job --backfill-job-id <id>` — resolves one persisted job and its child ranges. Renders job lifecycle, declared range, selector kind, resolved source identity, idempotency key, timestamps, failure metadata, and a `ranges` array sorted by range bounds and id.
- `bigname-worker inspect execution-trace --execution-trace-id <id>` — reads `execution_traces`, `execution_steps`, and trace-attachment metadata for one stored trace.
- Manifest-drift and proxy-alert inspection — joins stored alert observations to manifest/discovery identifiers, code-hash facts, proxy/implementation edges, and derived watch-target metadata. Does not fetch fresh chain state, create alerts, mutate alert lifecycle, mutate manifest truth, or change capability flags.

## Migration rules

- Schema changes land through checked-in migrations only.
- Append-only tables prefer additive changes over destructive rewrites.
- Backfill job and range checkpoint storage lands as additive `backfill_*` tables or additive columns; it does not overload `chain_lineage`, projection job state, or public API tables.
- Projection tables may be recreated when the rebuild path already exists.
- Migrations that change a shared interface require the companion doc update first.

## Repository ownership

- Storage owns migrations and query primitives.
- Storage owns backfill job/range helper primitives for idempotent create, reserve, advance, complete, and fail transitions.
- Worker/backfill code owns operational writes to `backfill_*` through those helpers, including finalized catch-up chunk creation and capacity pause/failure metadata.
- Adapters own inserts into identity and `normalized_events` tables.
- Projection workers own materialized read models.
- Execution workers own trace and step writes plus normal cache outcome writes.
- Synchronous indexer/reorg repair owns only `execution_cache_outcomes` deletes/invalidations tied to orphaned block dependencies.
- Raw-fact normalized-event replay is indexer-owned orchestration over the adapter-owned `normalized_events` boundary; selected-target replay scopes are operational scan bounds and do not change adapter ownership.
- Normalized replay cursor and adapter-checkpoint storage is indexer-owned operational state for resuming bounded replay; it does not define canonicality, widen backfill jobs, or change adapter event ownership.
- Intake owns durable hot raw-fact writes plus optional payload-cache metadata. Replay and inspection tooling may dereference object-backed cache or re-fetch provider payloads only through the digest-checked, fail-closed boundary.
- API code does not query raw-fact tables directly except for explicit audit endpoints.
- Canonicality, raw-fact, stored-lineage-range, backfill-job, and execution-trace inspection tooling is worker-owned and read-only over storage audit helpers; none expose public `v1` routes.
- Manifest drift and proxy alerting tooling is worker-owned observation over `manifest_*`, `discovery_*`, code-hash facts, proxy/implementation edges, and derived watch targets. Its live audit path writes only `manifest_alert_*`; its read-only inspection path renders those observations as operational JSON without writing `normalized_events` or mutating manifest/discovery/projection/API state.
