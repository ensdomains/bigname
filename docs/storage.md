# Storage Strategy

Status: Phase 0 baseline

This document freezes the internal persistence strategy enough for storage, intake, projection, and execution work to proceed in parallel.

## 1. Invariants

- durable raw facts are immutable; evictable full-payload cache entries and non-audit raw-log staging rows are not system-of-record facts once their replay contract is satisfied
- projections are disposable and rebuildable
- canonicality is explicit, never inferred from "latest row wins"
- execution traces and execution steps are durable audit artifacts; cache outcomes are reusable only while their dependencies remain canonical
- one write owner exists per storage family

## 2. Storage Layers

The system of record is split into six layers:

1. `chain_lineage`: block ancestry, fork points, hash-first reconciliation, head promotion, and the single durable header-anchor row per observed block hash
2. `raw_facts`: hot indexed replay facts, selected/admitted target-log staging or audit rows, selected transaction/receipt staging or audit rows, code hashes, fetched call snapshots, optional header/log-audit extensions, and compact payload-cache metadata
3. `manifests_and_discovery`: source manifests, discovered edges, rollout flags
4. `identity_and_events`: `NameSurface`, `SurfaceBinding`, resources, token lineage, normalized events
5. `projections`: current-state and collection read models
6. `execution`: durable traces and steps, `execution_cache_outcomes`, invalidation records

Only layers 1 through 5 are required to rebuild current declared state. Layer 6 is required to replay verified answers and explain them.

Worker-owned manifest/proxy alert observations are an operational persistence family alongside those truth layers. They record audit findings for drift and proxy implementation changes, but they are not manifest truth, discovery admission, projection state, public API state, or adapter-owned normalized events.

Postgres is the hot indexed and replay-focused store, not an archive-style raw corpus. It retains durable replay and audit facts:

- lineage and header anchors needed to reconcile forks, prove ancestry, promote checkpoints, and audit canonicality
- selected/admitted target logs and the minimal transaction and receipt fields while they are needed to decode those logs, route them through adapters, and append normalized events
- block-scoped call snapshots and enrichments only when they are part of a retained replay contract for normalized events, projections, or execution artifacts
- code-hash observations and discovery/proxy evidence needed by manifests, adapter routing, or audit tooling
- compact metadata and optional digests for full payloads that were fetched as cache but are not replay-critical hot rows

Raw-log retention has two modes. In minimal mode, `raw_logs`, selected
`raw_transactions`, and selected `raw_receipts` are adapter-replay staging rows:
they may be compacted after the normalized replay cursor has advanced past the
retained block range and the corresponding `normalized_events`, identity rows,
lineage rows, and projection rebuild inputs are durable. In log-audit mode, the
same rows remain durable audit facts and may retain the heavier indexes needed
for broad historical raw-fact replay and inspection. Switching between those
modes is operational policy only; it must not change route coverage, projection
truth, canonicality semantics, manifest rollout, or consumer-replacement
meaning.

The worker-owned operational command
`bigname-worker raw-facts compact-log-staging` is the manual compaction boundary
for minimal raw-log retention. It must refuse to compact unless the
`raw_fact_normalized_events` replay cursor is caught up and failure-free, and it
must operate only on raw-log staging families (`raw_logs`, selected
`raw_transactions`, selected `raw_receipts`). Log-audit deployments do not run
that compaction command for retained ranges.

Minimal raw-log compaction must retain enough non-raw-log state to keep reorg
repair and public reads correct: `chain_lineage` and compact `raw_blocks` remain
the block-hash path for losing-branch repair, and `normalized_events` carry the
block identity, source identity, event identity, and compact provenance needed
by projection rebuilds and history reads. If raw-log staging rows have already
been compacted, reorg repair marks normalized events and identity rows orphaned
from lineage; it may update zero raw-log rows for that range. Historical
adapter replay from compacted ranges is an explicit backfill/refetch operation
against the configured provider/cache substrate or requires log-audit
retention; it is not an implicit API fallback.

Large/full block payloads, non-indexed transaction, receipt, or block bodies,
and non-audit raw-log staging rows are evictable cache by default once the
selected replay contract has been satisfied. They may live inline during a hot
window, in local/provider cache, in hash-addressed object storage, or not be
retained at all. Hash-addressed cold storage is required only for payload
classes that a doc-first policy explicitly declares durable. If metadata is
retained for an evictable payload, it should be stable enough to explain what
was fetched, such as payload kind, chain id, block hash/number where
block-scoped, optional digest, size, content type or encoding, source
observation metadata, observed time, and canonicality state when applicable.

Historical backfill does not turn empty blocks into hot payload archives. For a
block with no selected target logs/facts and no replay-required enrichment, the
durable storage contract is limited to lineage/header anchors and any compact
audit metadata required by the selected retention policy. Full block bodies,
receipt bundles, transaction bundles, and payload-cache bytes for those empty
historical blocks remain evictable or absent unless a later doc-first policy
declares that payload class durable.

Provider re-fetch is an explicit, fallible cache-fill path. For block-scoped payloads, it must be block-hash-scoped, verify the retained digest before any bytes are used, and fail closed if the digest is absent, the digest mismatches, or the provider cannot serve the exact historical payload. Provider re-fetch is not a substitute for retaining lineage, normalized events, execution artifacts, or orphaned-branch audit truth. When minimal raw-log retention has compacted selected raw-log staging rows, provider or local execution-client re-fetch may be used only by an explicit backfill/replay repair that re-materializes the selected raw facts before asking adapters to append missing normalized events.

Local execution-client storage, including a same-host Reth database/static-file
store, is a provider/cache substrate rather than a new storage family. Client
table keys, row cursors, static-file offsets, or data-directory paths may appear
only in operational source metadata or evictable cache metadata. They are not
durable `raw_fact_ref` identities, normalized-event provenance, projection
inputs, or replacements for lineage/header anchors, normalized events,
code-hash observations, call snapshots, execution artifacts, or orphaned-branch
audit truth retained in Postgres. In minimal raw-log retention, they may be the
configured substrate used by explicit repair/backfill to re-materialize compacted
selected raw-log staging rows; in log-audit mode, the retained Postgres raw-log
rows are the audit source.

Retention windows and compaction cadence are operational policy. They do not change route coverage, API consistency semantics, manifest capability flags, rollout status, or consumer-replacement graduation.

## 3. ID Strategy

### Deterministic text IDs

- `logical_name_id = "<namespace>:<normalized_name>"`

This is stable, human-auditable, and can be derived without database lookup.

### Opaque stable IDs

Use `uuid` for:

- `resource_id`
- `token_lineage_id`
- `contract_instance_id`
- `surface_binding_id`
- `execution_trace_id`

Rules:

- UUID values are internal identities, not user-generated strings
- `resource_id` and `token_lineage_id` must survive projection rebuilds
- token IDs, node hashes, and resolver addresses are attributes, not identity anchors

ENSv1 continuity rules for adapters:

- mint one `resource_id` per distinct ENSv1 authority anchor and reuse it if that exact anchor becomes authoritative again after a gap
- for this slice, direct registry-only control, registrar-backed registration, and wrapper-backed control are distinct ENSv1 authority anchors
- direct registry-only control has no active `token_lineage_id`
- mint one `token_lineage_id` per distinct tokenized ENSv1 anchor and reuse it if that same tokenized anchor becomes authoritative again
- transfer, renewal, fuse updates, expiry / grace changes, and permission or scope changes inside the same current anchor append normalized events against the current `resource_id` but do not mint new `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, or `surface_binding_id` rows
- wrap, unwrap, and re-registration close the old binding range only when the authoritative anchor changes; unwrap back to the same still-live pre-wrap registrar lease reuses the prior registrar `resource_id` and `token_lineage_id`
- when authority moves to a different anchor, close or reactivate binding continuity as above and attach subsequent authority- and permission-family normalized events to the successor `resource_id`
- adapters do not rewrite predecessor-resource normalized events or infer successor-resource permissions from them; any successor effective permission state must come from normalized events attached to that successor `resource_id`
- for ENSv1 direct-authority cases in this slice, write `SurfaceBinding.binding_kind = declared_registry_path`; do not use a different binding kind merely because the authority anchor changed between registry, registrar, and wrapper control
- `ens_v1_wrapper_l1` identity input is the admitted NameWrapper contract instance plus the wrapped node. Wrapper ownership, fuse, expiry, wrap, unwrap, resolver, and TTL observations update the active wrapper-backed resource or close/reactivate bindings according to the authority-anchor rules above; they do not create a separate migration resource unless a later doc-first wrapper / migration history slice admits that behavior (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/NameWrapper.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/INameWrapper.sol:L27 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/INameWrapper.sol:L35 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol:L666 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol:L676 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol:L1022 @ ens_v1@91c966f).
- `ens_v1_resolver_l1` identity input is the resolver event emitter or admitted resolver contract instance plus the node and record selector. Generic retained resolver events may create observed selector/cache facts before the emitter has supported profile state; resolver addresses remain source-graph contract instances or time-ranged attributes, not `resource_id`s. Resolver-local approvals and delegates attach to active resolver-scoped permission rows only after the relevant profile admits that authorization family, and they do not backfill registry or wrapper authority (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/PublicResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/IAddrResolver.sol:L6 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/IAddressResolver.sol:L6 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/ITextResolver.sol:L5 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L38 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L44 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L78 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L97 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L114 @ ens_v1@91c966f).
- `ENSRegistryOld` identity input, if admitted, is a migration-aware input to `ens_v1_registry_l1`, not a separate current registry owner and not a latest-log-wins stream. Adapters may attach old-registry owner, child, TTL, and resolver observations to current topology only while the target node remains unmigrated; once a current-registry `NewOwner` marks that subnode migrated, later old-registry observations for that node remain raw/audit facts and must not rewrite the active `resource_id`, `surface_binding_id`, node resolver binding, TTL, child edge, or projection input. The root resolver exception may update only the `ROOT_NODE` resolver binding and resolver-discovery input. The current registry fallback contract reads old owner, resolver, and TTL only when the current registry has no record, while the pinned subgraph marks current `NewOwner` output as migrated and suppresses old-registry handlers except for root resolver (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENSRegistryWithFallback.sol:L18 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENSRegistryWithFallback.sol:L29 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENSRegistryWithFallback.sol:L40 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENSRegistry.sol:L153 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_subgraph/src/ensRegistry.ts:L134 @ ens_subgraph@723f1b6) (upstream: .refs/ens_subgraph/src/ensRegistry.ts:L238 @ ens_subgraph@723f1b6) (upstream: .refs/ens_subgraph/src/ensRegistry.ts:L246 @ ens_subgraph@723f1b6).

ENSv2 continuity rules for adapters:

- key `resource_id` by `(chain_id, registry_contract_instance_id, upstream_eac_resource)` after observing the upstream permissioned-registry resource, not by current ERC1155 token ID; upstream exposes both `getResource(anyId)` and `getTokenId(anyId)` and emits `TokenResource(tokenId, resource)` when the token is associated with the resource (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L67 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L72 @ ens_v2@554c309)
- normalize `TokenResource(tokenId, resource)` as `TokenResourceLinked` and use it to attach token-lineage state to the current resource; absence of this event means the adapter must not guess a token/resource link from token ID shape alone (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L216 @ ens_v2@554c309)
- normalize `TokenRegenerated(oldTokenId, newTokenId)` as `TokenRegenerated`; keep the same `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, and `surface_binding_id`, update the current token ID attribute, and append the event against the already linked resource because upstream regenerates the token after role grants or revokes while leaving the resource unchanged (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L69 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L429 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L451 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L461 @ ens_v2@554c309)
- mint a new `resource_id` when upstream creates a new EAC resource version for a label after unregister / re-register; upstream constructs resources from `eacVersionId` and token IDs from `tokenVersionId`, and unregister / re-register increments both counters rather than preserving the old permission scope (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L28 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L203 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L237 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L536 @ ens_v2@554c309)
- resolver-scoped permission resources belong to the admitted resolver contract instance plus upstream resolver EAC resource; `PermissionedResolver` creates name-, text-key-, and coin-type-specific EAC resources for setter permissions, so storage must preserve resolver scope instead of folding those grants into registry resources (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L70 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L239 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L257 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L282 @ ens_v2@554c309)
- store ENSv2 preimage observations only in adapter-owned identity/preimage and normalized-event families; name-bearing registry `LabelRegistered`, `LabelReserved`, and `ParentUpdated` events, registrar `NameRegistered` and `NameRenewed` events, and resolver `AliasChanged`, `NamedResource`, `NamedTextResource`, and `NamedAddrResource` events may append observations, but those observations must not insert projection rows, mutate manifest capability state, or promote public exact-name support. ENSv2 exact-name support may be read as supported only from the selected `sepolia-dev` manifest root when `ens_v2_registrar_l1` carries `exact_name_profile = "supported"`; raw logs, preimage facts, active rollout, and backfill completion do not graduate any other profile or capability (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L15 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L30 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L75 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/interfaces/IETHRegistrar.sol:L32 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/interfaces/IETHRegistrar.sol:L53 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/interfaces/IPermissionedResolver.sol:L14 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L132 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L142 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L153 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309)

`contract_instance_id` rules:

- mint a new `contract_instance_id` when a manifest-declared contract or discovery-admitted contract first enters the canonical source graph
- one admitted contract address on one chain maps to one stable `contract_instance_id` across all admission epochs
- reuse the same `contract_instance_id` when the same contract address remains admitted on the same chain and only manifest version, rollout state, code-hash observations, or edge activity changes
- if the same admitted contract address becomes active again after an inactive gap, reuse the prior `contract_instance_id` and record a new non-overlapping active range instead of minting another ID
- model proxy contracts and implementation contracts as separate contract instances; proxy implementation churn mutates discovery edges and active ranges, not the proxy ID
- if the watched contract's own admitted address changes, close the old instance active range and mint a new `contract_instance_id`; do not reuse the prior ID to represent the successor deployment, and represent any continuity between distinct instances with `migration` edges
- store contract addresses as time-ranged attributes for raw-fact lookup, log routing, and watch-plan materialization; addresses are never the primary key of the source graph
- roots use the same `contract_instance_id` rules as ordinary manifest-declared and discovery-admitted contracts
- ENSv1 and Basenames dynamic resolver discovery must keep contract admission separate from node resolver binding state. Each canonical nonzero registry-observed resolver address resolves to a stable `contract_instance_id` under the relevant resolver source family when admitted by the resolver discovery rule, while node-to-resolver bindings record which nodes currently select that resolver. Zero-address resolver observations close only the affected node-to-resolver binding; they do not delete prior contract instances or resolver-local facts, and they close a resolver discovery edge or derived watch target only when no active canonical node binding or direct manifest admission still requires that resolver. Resolver addresses remain source-graph contract instances or time-ranged attributes, not `resource_id`s (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENS.sol:L12 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENSRegistry.sol:L89 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L132 @ basenames@1809bbc).

### Append-only event IDs

Use `bigint generated always as identity` for:

- raw fact rows
- normalized event rows
- projection job rows

## 4. Table Families And Write Ownership

| Family | Write owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chain_*` | intake | lineage and canonical block graph |
| `raw_*` | intake | immutable hot replay facts plus payload-cache metadata for blockchain and execution inputs |
| `backfill_*` | worker/backfill substrate | persisted backfill jobs, bounded range leases, and resumable range checkpoints; not chain head checkpoints |
| `normalized_replay_*` | indexer/replay orchestration | operational replay cursors only; not canonicality, backfill, adapter, projection, or API state |
| `manifest_*` | manifests/discovery | source manifests, declared contract admission, capability versions |
| `discovery_*` | manifests/discovery | canonical reachable contract graph and watch-plan expansion keyed by `contract_instance_id` |
| `manifest_alert_*` | worker/audit | persisted manifest-drift and proxy-alert observations; operational only, not manifest truth or public API state |
| `name_surfaces`, `surface_bindings`, `resources`, `token_lineages` | adapters | stable identity anchors |
| `normalized_events` | adapters | append-only normalized protocol events |
| `projection_*` | projection workers | disposable read models |
| `current_projection_replay_status` | projection workers | durable operational completion markers for automatic all-current projection replay; not API truth or projection data |
| `execution_*` | execution workers; synchronous indexer/reorg repair for orphan-block cache outcome deletes only | durable traces and steps, normal `execution_cache_outcomes` writes, invalidation records |

The API process is read-only against storage.

Within the `execution_*` family, the only non-execution-worker write owner is synchronous indexer/reorg repair during chain reconciliation. That path may delete or invalidate reusable `execution_cache_outcomes` rows whose dependency set includes an orphaned block identity; it does not write execution traces, execution steps, normal execution outcomes, projections, API state, or manifest state.

For ENSv1 identity rows and normalized authority / permission events, adapters are responsible for minting and reusing `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, and `surface_binding_id` according to the continuity rules above and for attaching normalized events to the authoritative `resource_id` in effect at that chain position. Projection workers consume those identity rows and normalized events; they do not infer alternate continuity or synthesize cross-resource permission carry on their own.
For interval identity rows such as `surface_bindings`, `active_from` and the stable identity anchors are immutable, while `active_to` is a replay-derived close boundary. Canonical historical replay may tighten an existing non-null `active_to` to an earlier close point when older or more complete facts reveal that the binding ended sooner; it must not extend a closed interval or reopen it.
When a bounded replay chunk emits a historical ENSv1 `surface_bindings` segment for an authority anchor that is no longer current at the chunk head, the adapter must still materialize the referenced `resource_id` and any `token_lineage_id` in the same write boundary. Chunk shape must not decide whether a closed registration or wrapper binding has valid identity parents.

For ENSv1 old-registry admission, adapters own the migration guard before a raw old-registry log can become a topology-changing normalized event. Storage helpers, projection workers, and API reads must not merge old and current registry rows by block order alone; canonicality-aware replay re-applies the same migrated-node rule and root resolver exception before writing current-state projections (upstream: .refs/ens_subgraph/src/ensRegistry.ts:L238 @ ens_subgraph@723f1b6) (upstream: .refs/ens_subgraph/src/ensRegistry.ts:L246 @ ens_subgraph@723f1b6).

For ENSv1 wrapper and resolver Phase 4 rows, adapters may append normalized identity, authority, permission, resolver-change, record, preimage, fuse, and expiry events from the admitted NameWrapper and PublicResolver families. They must not write projection rows, mutate manifest capability state, infer route coverage graduation, or persist wrapper upgrade / migration history from the wrapper upgrade path without a later doc-first admission of that history surface. Resolver `NameChanged` text from an admitted reverse / primary claim path may seed a forward-name preimage and release pending forward-node observations, but it remains preimage/intake metadata rather than authority or primary-name truth unless the matching forward-node registry / resolver facts exist independently (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol:L479 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol:L500 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/NameResolver.sol:L10 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/NameResolver.sol:L18 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L129 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L130 @ ens_v1@91c966f).
For ENSv1 wrapper-backed permission rows, adapters own the `PermissionScopeChanged` normalized event that carries the wrapper fuse value, and projection workers own applying that modifier to `permissions_current`. The API must not infer fuse state from raw logs, resource provenance, or wrapper contract calls at read time; if canonical replay or reorg repair changes the current `PermissionScopeChanged` input for a wrapper resource, `permissions_current` is invalidated and rebuilt from normalized events. Upstream exposes the NameWrapper fuse values in `NameWrapped` and `FusesSet`, stores fuses in wrapper data, and checks those fuses before protected wrapper operations (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/INameWrapper.sol:L31 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/INameWrapper.sol:L37 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/INameWrapper.sol:L150 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol:L686 @ ens_v1@91c966f).

For ENSv1 and Basenames dynamic resolver discovery, manifests/discovery owns the `contract_instance_id` and discovery-edge admission created from registry `NewResolver` observations, while adapter/projection state owns the node-to-resolver binding lifetime. For ENSv1, retained generic resolver-local record/version events may be normalized as observed selector/cache or version-boundary facts even when the emitter's resolver-profile state is still `pending`, provided the event can be tied to the selected resolver binding and node and the log decodes to the upstream resolver event shape. A generic resolver-topic collision with malformed or incompatible indexed fields / ABI payload remains a retained raw fact but does not emit a normalized selector/cache fact (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/IAddressResolver.sol:L6 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/INameResolver.sol:L5 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/ITextResolver.sol:L5 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/ITextResolver.sol:L10 @ ens_v1@91c966f). Supported resolver-profile admission is still required before projection workers or API reads claim complete family coverage, resolver overview support, resolver-local authorization semantics, latest-only behavior, or event-to-onchain-call parity; unobserved selectors must surface explicit unsupported or gap state. Basenames profile-gated resolver-local fact admission remains governed by the separate `L2Resolver`-compatible rule below (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENS.sol:L12 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/IAddrResolver.sol:L6 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/IAddressResolver.sol:L6 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/ITextResolver.sol:L5 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/profiles/IVersionableResolver.sol:L5 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L132 @ basenames@1809bbc).

Generic ENSv1 resolver-local observation is not storage authority for supported record families. Pubkey evidence is ignored by the current profile model. `DataResolver` evidence may be retained as resolver-family evidence, but it remains unsupported for known PublicResolver-generation profiles and pending / unknown for unknown resolver implementations until explicit profile admission changes that state. Storage helpers must preserve that distinction instead of converting an observed generic resolver record into a supported profile fact.

ENSv1 resolver-profile state is separate from contract-instance admission and separate from baseline generic event intake. For discovered ENSv1 resolver instances, Phase 4 supports only explicit ENS Labs PublicResolver-generation profiles for complete record, record-version, resolver overview, resolver-local authorization, and onchain-call parity claims. Profile admission state is keyed conceptually by `contract_instance_id`, source family, profile name, fact family, and active range; it records whether the instance is `supported`, `pending`, or `unsupported`, plus provenance such as direct mainnet manifest admission, first-party known-resolver admission, the stored code-hash fact, or proxy / implementation edge used for the decision. This freeze does not require a new profile-fact table: until a later doc-first storage family exists, the state may be derived from existing discovery provenance, normalized resolver-discovery events, manifest contract roles, and code-hash / proxy-edge facts. Unknown dynamic resolvers and unsupported interfaces on older generations must retain explicit derived `pending` or `unsupported` profile state for profile-gated behavior until a later doc-first admission supports them, but retained generic resolver-local record events may still contribute observed selector/cache facts. The latest app-known PublicResolver profile is anchored to the upstream PublicResolver mixin surface, ERC165 support, and ResolverBase record-versioning, but older admitted generations expose only their listed subset; Basenames profile admission is frozen separately below (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L20 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L31 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L131 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L150 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/ResolverBase.sol:L17 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/ResolverBase.sol:L23 @ ens_v1@91c966f).

Basenames resolver-profile state is also separate from contract-instance admission. For discovered Base-side resolver instances, Phase 8 supports only the `L2Resolver`-compatible profile for the relevant resolver-local record and authorization fact families. Profile admission state uses the same conceptual key shape as ENSv1, keyed by `contract_instance_id`, source family, profile name, fact family, and active range, and it remains derived from existing discovery provenance, normalized resolver-discovery events, stored code-hash / proxy-edge facts, ERC165 evidence, ABI-family admission, or supported resolver-event evidence until a later doc-first storage family exists. This freeze does not require a new profile-fact table, storage migration, shared enum, manifest schema field, or API route widening. Unknown dynamic Base resolvers must retain explicit derived `pending` or `unsupported` profile state until a later doc-first admission supports them. The Basenames gate is separate from ENSv1 PublicResolver-generation profile admission, the Ethereum Mainnet `L1Resolver` transport / execution families, and offchain-gateway admission (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L132 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L4 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L16 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L182 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L193 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L209 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L225 @ basenames@1809bbc).

For ENSv2 identity rows and normalized event rows, adapters own the same boundary: they mint and reuse `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, and `surface_binding_id`, append `TokenResourceLinked`, `TokenRegenerated`, `SubregistryChanged`, `ParentChanged`, `AliasChanged`, permission events, and preimage observations from name-bearing events, and never write projection rows. Projection workers consume those events; they do not infer token-resource links, subregistry reachability, alias targets, wildcard coverage, EAC-derived effective powers, or exact-name support directly from raw logs, preimage observations, or manifest presence (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L15 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L30 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L49 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L75 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/interfaces/IETHRegistrar.sol:L32 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/interfaces/IETHRegistrar.sol:L53 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/interfaces/IPermissionedResolver.sol:L14 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/access-control/interfaces/IEnhancedAccessControl.sol:L19 @ ens_v2@554c309).

Raw-fact normalized-event replay does not introduce a new event storage owner. The indexer-owned operational runner may select bounded canonical raw facts and ask the adapter-owned `normalized_events` boundary to perform an upsert-only resync for the corresponding rows; it may advance only its own `normalized_replay_*` operational cursor while doing so. Whole-range replay remains the default for explicit replay requests, automatic normalized-event catch-up, and backfill jobs whose selector intentionally covers the active watched set. Automatic full bootstrap is such a whole-range intake mode: overlapping source families share one raw-fact job segment, and ENSv1 generic resolver events are topic-scanned across all emitters in that segment while other selected source families keep address-scoped filters. Automatic normalized-event catch-up must also use one all-source chain cursor over persisted canonical raw facts in block order; it must not run independent per-source-family cursors because adapter-owned identity histories may combine registry, registrar, wrapper, resolver, and reverse-claim signals into one storage write boundary. Bootstrap catch-up and per-source-family catch-up may pass a resolved selected-target scope into replay only when the completed raw range is known to have been produced for that narrower target set. For ENSv1 resolver events, source-scoped or per-target resolver replay/backfill is an operational repair and targeting mode over stored raw facts; it is not the default semantic model for generic resolver-event intake and must not turn resolver profiles into an address filter for observed selector/cache facts. A scoped replay narrows only the raw-log selection and adapter source scope by admitted source family, address, and effective block range; it does not narrow canonicality, change the persisted backfill job identity, delete raw facts from other sources, mutate discovery or manifests, or graduate coverage. It must not let storage helpers, projections, API code, or inspection tooling synthesize normalized events directly. Replay reads canonical durable hot facts first. It may use a retained durable cold payload only when an explicitly retained replay contract requires that payload. For block-scoped payloads, it may use provider re-fetch only through an explicit block-hash-scoped, retained-digest-checked, fail-closed cache-fill path; if no retained digest exists, the payload cannot satisfy that contract. Provider re-fetch must not replace selected replay facts that the docs require Postgres to retain. Replay does not delete stale `normalized_events` or replace existing payloads for an already persisted normalized-event identity; the storage upsert path inserts absent rows and refreshes canonicality for matching identities, while conflicting payloads remain mismatches. A retry may mark adapter-owned identity rows `orphaned` only when those rows have no backing normalized event, were produced by the same adapter boundary, and would otherwise overlap the incoming identity interval; this failed-attempt cleanup does not apply to `normalized_events` and must not replace normalized-event payloads. Replay must not mutate `chain_*`, `raw_*`, `backfill_*`, `projection_*`, `execution_*`, manifests, discovery rows, public API state, or checkpoint promotion state.
During fresh normalized replay, where current projection tables are empty and the normalized replay cursor has not reached its target, the indexer may temporarily defer normalized-event indexes that exist only for projection/API readback and retain narrower replay-required indexes for event identity, reverse-claim lookup, and latest resolver/version preloads. This is an operational bulk-load optimization only: it does not change event identity, replay scope, coverage, canonicality, or projection ownership. Deferred indexes must be recreated before projection rebuilds or API-ready declared reads are treated as complete. Automatic all-current projection replay may persist `current_projection_replay_status` rows after each projection family completes, so worker restarts resume from the first unfinished projection family instead of restarting the whole bootstrap replay. Those rows are worker-owned operational progress only: they do not make a projection canonical, do not change the API-read boundary, and must be ignored unless the recorded replay version is still current. The recorded normalized target block is operational metadata for inspection, not a public consistency checkpoint.
Name-bearing raw logs whose dynamic label payload cannot be decoded, or whose decoded dynamic label cannot be represented as a retained DNS-wire preimage, remain retained raw facts but do not emit a `PreimageObserved` normalized event. That decode outcome is not a fatal replay condition, does not imply a projection row, and does not graduate coverage.
The same non-fatal rule applies when ENSv1 unwrapped-authority replay sees a registrar grant or renewal label that cannot be ABI-decoded, cannot be UTF-8 decoded, cannot be represented in the retained DNS-wire name form, or whose decoded label does not match the indexed labelhash: the raw fact remains retained, but the adapter skips that authority observation instead of creating identity, authority, permission, or projection state from inconsistent name evidence.
ENSv1 generic resolver-topic replay follows the same retained-fact rule for malformed resolver-local payloads: if a topic match cannot be decoded as the declared resolver event or the indexed payload does not match the decoded value, the adapter skips the selector/cache observation rather than aborting replay or inventing a projection row.
ENSv1 unwrapped-authority replay must settle any due registrar release boundary before applying a later registrar, registry, wrapper, or resolver observation for the same name history. If a renewal is observed after the prior lease has released, the replay treats it as opening a fresh registrar authority before applying the renewal payload, so chunk-local replay and later fuller historical replay derive the same resource and before-state identities.
Chunk-local replay may settle only release boundaries at or before the selected replay high-water block. It must not use the global chain head to synthesize future registrar releases before intervening raw facts in later chunks have been replayed.

At minimum, manifests/discovery persistence must carry:

- `contract_instances`: one row per stable `contract_instance_id` with chain, contract kind, and provenance; roots use the same identity family as other contract instances
- `contract_instance_addresses`: time-ranged address attributes keyed by `contract_instance_id` for lookup from raw facts and watch targets to source-graph identity; one `contract_instance_id` may carry multiple non-overlapping active ranges when the same address is re-admitted after an inactive gap, and manifest-declared address ranges may carry nullable inclusive `start_block` metadata where the manifest supplied it
- `discovery_edges`: edges keyed by `edge_id` with `from_contract_instance_id`, `to_contract_instance_id`, `edge_kind`, active range, provenance, and canonicality
- resolver-profile admission state, when present: status and provenance keyed conceptually by `contract_instance_id`, source family, supported profile, fact family, and active range; it may be derived from existing discovery / normalized-event / code-hash / proxy-edge material until a later doc-first storage family exists, and it gates complete-family, resolver-overview, latest-only behavior, authorization, and onchain-call parity claims rather than baseline ENSv1 generic resolver-event observation; it is not manifest truth, a capability flag, or public coverage state
- any materialized watch-plan table keyed by `contract_instance_id` plus chain and range, including root start nodes keyed by the root `contract_instance_id`; raw address is a derived watch target, not the durable identity, and an omitted `start_block` is persisted as unknown/null rather than converted to block zero or a job start

The worker-owned `manifest_alert_*` family persists manifest/proxy alert observations produced by the audit job. At minimum it must carry an observation identity, observation kind (`manifest_drift` or `proxy_implementation_drift`), lifecycle status, manifest version, source family, chain, contract-instance references, nullable proxy / implementation edge references, expected and observed code-hash or implementation-edge material, derived watch-plan metadata, first/last observed timestamps, and nullable remediation metadata. Writing this family must not write adapter-owned `normalized_events`, mutate manifest truth, mutate discovery admission, admit contracts, rewrite discovery edges, change capability flags, update watch-plan inputs, write projections, expose public API state, or claim consumer replacement. A proxy implementation observation preserves the proxy `contract_instance_id`; implementation churn is represented by an observed or admitted proxy / implementation edge, not by minting a replacement proxy identity.

Read-only manifest-drift and proxy-alert inspection reads the persisted worker-owned alert observations and renders operational JSON only. Inspection helpers may join stored alert rows to manifest/discovery identifiers, code-hash facts, proxy / implementation edges, and derived watch-target metadata, but they must not fetch fresh chain state, create alert rows, mutate alert lifecycle state, mutate manifest truth, mutate discovery admission, admit contracts, change capability flags, rewrite discovery edges, update watch-plan inputs, write projections, expose public API state, or claim consumer replacement.

At minimum, backfill persistence must carry:

- `backfill_jobs`: one row per bounded backfill job with selected profile, chain, selector kind, resolved source identity, scan mode, declared range start and end, idempotency key, lifecycle status, failure metadata, and timestamp metadata
- `backfill_ranges`: child rows or equivalent range records with declared range bounds, next checkpoint, lease owner, lease token, lease expiry, attempt counters, lifecycle status, failure metadata, and timestamp metadata
- monotonic helper-owned checkpoint fields that allow a worker to resume after crash without widening the original range or reclassifying already admitted facts

Operational finalized catch-up uses these same `backfill_*` families. It may
create many finite chunks, but each chunk must preserve one immutable job shape
and idempotency key. Capacity checks are part of the chunk lifecycle: before
range work starts, the worker must check current Postgres size, writable free
disk, and any configured object-cache budget, and record an explicit failure or
paused state in existing lifecycle/failure metadata when capacity is
insufficient. Capacity failures must not mutate raw facts, canonicality state,
selected target identity, chain checkpoints, projections, manifests, discovery,
or public API state.

Backfill source selector storage freezes the job identity fields used by the source-scoped runner:

- `selector_kind`: one of `whole_active_watched_chain`, `source_family`, or `watched_target_set`
- `source_family`: the requested family string for `selector_kind=source_family`, otherwise `null`
- `requested_watched_targets`: the caller-supplied watched target identities for `selector_kind=watched_target_set`, otherwise an empty array
- `requested_watched_targets[*].contract_instance_id`
- `selected_targets`: the resolved materialized target set sorted by `source_family`, `contract_instance_id`, normalized address, effective target range start, and effective target range end
- `selected_targets[*].source_family`
- `selected_targets[*].contract_instance_id`
- `selected_targets[*].address`
- `selected_targets[*].effective_from_block`
- `selected_targets[*].effective_to_block`
- `source_identity_hash`: a digest of `selector_kind`, `source_family`, `requested_watched_targets`, and `selected_targets`; the canonical selector payload remains authoritative if a hash collision or payload mismatch is detected

Very large source-family jobs may persist compact selector identity instead of a
full `selected_targets` array in the job row. Compact identity sets
`source_identity_payload_format=selected_targets_digest_v1` and carries
`selected_target_count`, `selected_targets_digest_algorithm`,
`selected_targets_digest`, a first/last `selected_targets_sample`, and
`source_identity_hash`. The digest input is still the sorted canonical
`selected_targets` tuple above; compact storage avoids making one operational
JSONB row scale with every resolver instance while preserving immutable
idempotency-key comparison.

The selected target range fields are the intersection of the watched target's active range with the job's finite declared block range. `effective_to_block` is finite for every persisted selected target because backfill jobs are finite at creation time.

Automatic bootstrap backfill uses the same `backfill_jobs`,
`backfill_ranges`, and source-identity payloads as explicitly requested
backfill. It must persist finite declared range bounds before job creation and
store selected targets keyed by `contract_instance_id` plus effective range.
Explicit backfill and replay requests remain whole-selector operations by
default: a source-family or watched-target job may fetch many selected targets
together and replay the completed raw range as a whole unless the caller passes
a narrower selected-target replay scope. Bootstrap may segment targets by
manifest start/end boundaries and may replay a completed segment with that
segment's selected-target scope so that newly admitted historical contracts do
not force unrelated source families in the same block span to rescan.
For configured chains, bootstrap ranges start at each eligible target's
manifest/discovery admitted start and end at the finite provider head observed
at job creation time; bootstrap must not replace that start with an arbitrary
recent-window cap. A watched target whose manifest-declared `start_block` is
unknown is skipped by bootstrap and leaves no synthetic block-zero,
provider-history, recent-window, or job-start range in `backfill_*`.

Backfill job and range checkpoint rows are operational state. They do not replace `chain_lineage`, do not define canonicality, and do not promote `canonical_head`, `safe_head`, or `finalized_head`.

Source-family backfill conformance for the admitted ENSv1 wrapper and resolver families and the admitted Basenames families is evidence over completed `backfill_*` job/range lifecycle state plus replayed existing shipped consumer-capability responses. It does not add a storage family, write projection rows, mutate manifests or discovery, graduate route coverage, expand public API routes, promote additional ENSv2 profiles, claim wrapper / migration history support, or change consumer-replacement meaning (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/NameWrapper.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/PublicResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc).

## 5. Partitioning Baseline

Start with partitioning on the highest-volume append-only tables:

- `chain_lineage`
- `chain_header_audit`, if auditable header retention produces enough rows to justify partitioning
- `raw_transactions`
- `raw_receipts`
- `raw_logs`
- `normalized_events`
- `execution_steps`

For `chain_lineage`, `chain_header_audit`, `raw_transactions`, and `raw_receipts`, partitioning applies to hot replay facts and any payload-cache metadata retained in Postgres. It is not a requirement to keep full block, transaction, receipt, or block-header audit bodies inline after those payloads are outside the hot reorg/replay window or were not selected for admitted target replay.

Partition keys:

- `chain_id`
- block-number range

Current-state projection tables start unpartitioned unless measurements prove otherwise.

## 6. Canonicality Model

`chain_lineage` persists the recent reconciled block window keyed by `(chain_id, block_hash)` and carries the fields needed to recover canonical ancestry:

- `parent_hash`
- `block_number`
- `timestamp`
- checkpoint-promotion state

Header audit fields are optional retention, not ancestry identity. The default
lineage contract omits `logs_bloom`, `transactions_root`, `receipts_root`, and
`state_root`; reorg repair walks backward through `(block_hash, parent_hash)`
until it reaches a stored matching ancestor, then marks the losing stored branch
and dependent facts noncanonical from that point forward. An explicit
auditable-header retention mode stores those fields in `chain_header_audit`,
keyed by the same `(chain_id, block_hash)`, so inspection tooling can explain or
cross-check fetched block payloads, receipts, logs, and state anchors without
doubling the normal per-block anchor rows. Their absence must not prevent
canonicality repair, checkpoint promotion, replay over retained selected facts,
or projection rebuilds. Minimal intake writes only `chain_lineage`; auditable
intake may retain or backfill `chain_header_audit` without making absent audit
fields an identity conflict. If both stored and incoming audit rows carry the
same audit field, mismatches remain hard storage conflicts.

`raw_blocks` is not a durable table. Intake, replay, workers, adapters, audit
helpers, and tests read block timestamps and canonicality from `chain_lineage`
directly and read optional audit roots or bloom from `chain_header_audit` when
auditable retention is enabled. Normal replay batches block-anchor admission
once through the `chain_lineage` write boundary.

Every fact-derived row that can be invalidated by reorg carries:

- `chain_id`
- `block_number`
- `block_hash`
- `canonicality_state`
- `observed_at`

`canonicality_state` values:

- `observed`
- `canonical`
- `safe`
- `finalized`
- `orphaned`

Rules:

- block hash is the identity anchor; block number is position only
- fork detection marks affected rows `orphaned`; it does not delete them
- reorg repair preserves lineage and normalized event/identity canonicality for losing branches as audit truth; log-audit mode also preserves selected raw-log/transaction/receipt facts, while minimal raw-log retention may already have compacted those staging rows. Evictable payload-cache bytes or compacted staging rows must not erase canonicality, normalized-event provenance, or replay-critical evidence retained by the selected policy
- optional header audit fields are verified when both stored and incoming audit rows carry them, and may be filled when an auditable replay observes a previously minimal row, but a minimal replay must not conflict with an existing auditable row solely because the replay omitted those fields
- projection rebuilds read rows that are `canonical`, `safe`, or `finalized` by default
- history and audit tools may opt into `observed` and `orphaned` rows explicitly
- safe and finalized promotion is monotonic per chain

Execution cache rows follow the same hash-first canonicality rule. When reorg repair marks a block identity `orphaned`, synchronous indexer/reorg repair invalidates or deletes any reusable `execution_cache_outcomes` row for verified resolution or verified primary-name readback whose dependency set includes that `(chain_id, block_hash)` or a boundary resolved through it. The invalidation makes the cached outcome ineligible for reuse; it must not delete raw facts, execution traces, execution steps, trace attachments, or any execution-owned audit artifact.

Reusable `execution_cache_outcomes` rows must carry dependencies tied to explicit block-hash-bearing chain positions or boundaries. Rows for verified resolution or verified primary-name readback that lack those dependencies fail closed; rows for request types explicitly documented as outside this reorg invalidation surface remain out of scope rather than being treated as reorg-safe by omission.

Backfill range checkpoints are separate from canonicality checkpoints. Advancing or completing a backfill job records only that bounded fetch/resume work reached a position in its declared range; it must not change any `canonicality_state` value and must not advance `canonical_head`, `safe_head`, or `finalized_head`.

Backfill raw admission still writes canonicality for the facts it admits. When
the admitted historical range is already proven canonical, safe, or finalized by
retained lineage or provider checkpoint evidence, new lineage, raw-fact, and
normalized-event rows must use `canonical`, `safe`, or `finalized` as
appropriate instead of leaving those rows `observed` solely because the source
was backfill. If the evidence is absent, the storage layer must preserve the
weaker explicit state and leave the gap visible to audit and coverage tooling.
Re-observing a previously stored block identity must still validate the
immutable block fields before accepting the fact, but storage helpers may skip
the physical row update when the replayed canonicality state would not improve
or otherwise change the stored state. This no-op skip is an implementation
optimization only: it must not hide identity mismatches, suppress orphaning,
advance chain checkpoints, or make a missing raw fact appear covered.
Automatic normalized replay cursor rewind checks must remain bounded by the
single all-source chain cursor and raw-fact observation time, so a no-op
catch-up chunk does not rescan the full historical raw-log prefix. Explicit
selected-target replay may add its source scope to the same observation-time
rewind rule.

Read-only canonicality inspection uses storage audit helpers over `chain_lineage`, `chain_header_audit`, raw fact tables, retained payload-cache metadata, and `normalized_events`. The worker single-block inspection contract remains `bigname-worker inspect canonicality --chain-id <id> --block-hash <hash>` and resolves one `(chain_id, block_hash)`. For that requested block hash, helpers may report whether a stored lineage row exists and, for stored rows, block lineage, parent hash, block number, canonicality state, optional header-audit presence, raw fact counts, payload-cache metadata counts or digests where retained, and normalized-event counts.

Read-only stored lineage range inspection is worker-owned operational tooling over `chain_lineage`. The bounded command `bigname-worker inspect stored-lineage-range` lists only lineage rows already stored for the requested chain and finite block range, ordered stably by `(block_number, block_hash)` unless a later doc-first contract adds another explicit order. It renders stable JSON per observed block with chain id, block number, block hash, parent hash, canonicality state, timestamp, and any stored promotion markers; nullable stored fields render as `null` rather than disappearing. It must not infer missing heights, gaps, span-wide canonicality, aggregate finality, or completeness for the requested range. It must not mutate lineage, raw facts, normalized events, projections, execution cache rows, backfill jobs, backfill range checkpoints, or `canonical_head`, `safe_head`, or `finalized_head`.

Read-only backfill job inspection uses storage audit helpers over `backfill_jobs` and `backfill_ranges`. The worker inspection contract is job-id only: `bigname-worker inspect backfill-job --backfill-job-id <id>` resolves one persisted job and its child ranges. It renders stable JSON with the job lifecycle, declared range, selector kind, resolved source identity, idempotency key, timestamp metadata, failure metadata, and a `ranges` array sorted by range bounds and range id. Each range object includes lifecycle status, declared bounds, range checkpoint, lease owner/token/expiry, attempt count, timestamp metadata, and failure metadata. Nullable lease, completion, and failure fields must render as `null` or an empty metadata object rather than disappearing. The command is read-only: it must not reserve ranges, refresh leases, advance checkpoints, complete or fail jobs, mutate chain lineage, mutate raw facts, update projections, update execution cache rows, or promote `canonical_head`, `safe_head`, or `finalized_head`.

## 7. Projection Storage Rules

Every current-state projection row carries:

- provenance pointers
- manifest version
- relevant chain positions
- canonicality summary
- last recomputed timestamp

Projection tables may be truncated and rebuilt from canonical facts plus normalized events.

Exact-name snapshot selection is a storage read boundary, not a new storage family. The API resolves `at`, explicit `chain_positions`, and `consistency` to one concrete `ChainPositions` object, then reads only projection rows and execution outputs eligible for that exact object. `name_current`, `coverage_current`, `surface_bindings_current`, `permissions_current`, and `record_inventory_current` must retain enough chain-position context for the API to reject mismatched joins rather than combine rows from different snapshots.

If the selected exact-name positions are valid but no eligible projection or persisted execution output exists, the serving path returns the documented `stale`, `unsupported`, or `not_found` API state for that route and mode. It must not read raw facts, adapter-owned identity/event rows, or provider data directly to fill the public exact-name, coverage, topology, explain, or verified-readback response.

## 8. Raw Payload Cache and Object Storage

Persist durable raw replay facts inline in Postgres when they are needed for indexed lookup, adapter replay, projection rebuild, execution-output rebuild, canonicality audit, or selected-target backfill proof. Treat large/full raw payload bytes as cache unless a doc-first policy declares that payload class durable:

- full block bodies outside the hot reorg/replay window
- non-indexed transaction bodies
- non-indexed receipt bodies
- block-scoped payload batches fetched by live ingestion or backfill but not selected for admitted target replay
- full payload cache or block bundles for historical blocks with no selected target facts or replay-required enrichments

Evictable payload cache may be inline, local, object-backed, provider-refetchable, or absent after durable facts are extracted. Postgres stores only the metadata needed by the selected retention contract, such as payload kind, block identity fields, digest when the payload may later be dereferenced or refetched, size, content type or encoding, object key when object-backed, and observation metadata. Cache metadata without a retained digest may describe what was fetched, but it cannot authorize later byte use. Reads that dereference object-backed cache or re-fetch from a provider must verify the retained digest before use and fail closed on missing digest, mismatch, or unavailable historical data.

Hash-addressed object storage is a durability boundary only for raw payload classes explicitly declared durable. It is an implementation detail for evictable cache otherwise and must not be required for every fetched full block, transaction, or receipt body.

Persist small execution payloads inline in Postgres:

- request metadata
- response digests
- decoded final values
- failure reasons

Persist large payloads in object storage addressed by SHA-256 digest:

- CCIP payload bodies
- large metadata responses
- trace attachments

Postgres stores the digest, size, content type, and object key for execution attachments as well.

The execution storage boundary separates durable audit artifacts from cache reuse. `execution_traces` and `execution_steps` preserve what was executed and why; normal `execution_cache_outcomes` writes record whether a verified outcome can be reused under its request key, manifest versions, and block-hash-bearing dependency boundaries. Phase 9 reorg invalidation updates cache eligibility only through the synchronous indexer/reorg repair exception and does not change the selected ENSv2 exact-name support boundary, widen verified execution support, promote additional deployment profiles, or graduate any manifest capability.

Exact block-anchored `raw_call_snapshots` used by verified resolution stay in the intake-owned `raw_*` family rather than `execution_*`. Execution may hand off candidate snapshots for persistence only through that raw-fact boundary, only for the exact requested chain position, and only for support classes that explicitly admit them; `execution_traces`, `execution_steps`, and `execution_cache_outcomes` do not own those rows.

Before a verified-resolution selector may persist as a supported reusable outcome, execution must reload from storage the exact manifest versions for the request, the same declared topology snapshot the mixed route would serve for the same request and chain positions, and any resolver-profile admission state already required by the participating resolver-local fact families. The frozen support class is derived from those stored inputs and must match the persisted trace and cache key. If the stored inputs are absent or do not re-establish one frozen supported class, the trace may remain a durable audit artifact but the selector must not persist as a supported reusable outcome.

Worker-owned execution trace inspection reads only persisted `execution_traces`, `execution_steps`, and trace attachment metadata needed to render stable operational JSON for one stored trace. Inspection helpers must not execute fresh calls, read adapter internals, synthesize declared topology, mutate `execution_cache_outcomes`, write projections, update manifests or discovery rows, or expose a public `v1` route.

## 9. Migration Rules

- schema changes land through checked-in migrations only
- append-only tables prefer additive changes over destructive rewrites
- backfill job and range checkpoint storage lands as additive `backfill_*` tables or additive columns; it must not overload `chain_lineage`, projection job state, or public API tables
- projection tables may be recreated when the rebuild path already exists
- migrations that change a shared interface require the companion doc update first

## 10. Repository Ownership Implications

To keep parallel work safe:

- storage owns migrations and query primitives
- storage owns backfill job/range helper primitives for idempotent create, reserve, advance, complete, and fail transitions
- worker/backfill code owns operational writes to `backfill_*` through those helpers, including finalized catch-up chunk creation and capacity pause/failure metadata
- adapters own inserts into identity and normalized-event tables
- projection workers own materialized read models
- execution workers own trace and step writes plus normal cache outcome writes
- synchronous indexer/reorg repair owns only `execution_cache_outcomes` deletes or invalidations tied to orphaned block dependencies
- raw-fact normalized-event replay is indexer-owned orchestration over the adapter-owned `normalized_events` boundary; it reads persisted canonical raw facts and may upsert only the corresponding `normalized_events` without normalized-event stale-row purge or payload replacement; selected-target replay scopes are operational scan bounds and do not change adapter ownership
- normalized replay cursor storage is indexer-owned operational state used only to resume bounded raw-fact normalized-event replay; it does not define canonicality, widen backfill jobs, or change adapter event ownership
- intake owns durable hot raw-fact writes plus optional payload-cache metadata for block-scoped payloads; replay and inspection tooling may dereference object-backed cache or re-fetch provider payloads only through an explicit block-hash-scoped, retained-digest-checked, fail-closed boundary and must not refetch provider history as a substitute for retained replay inputs
- API code must not query raw-fact tables directly except for explicit audit endpoints
- canonicality, raw-fact, and stored lineage range inspection tooling is worker-owned, read-only operational tooling over storage audit helpers; it does not create a public `v1` route, infer missing lineage, or bypass the API boundary for user-facing reads
- backfill job inspection tooling is worker-owned, read-only operational tooling over `backfill_*`; it does not create a public `v1` route, mutate operational state, or bypass API read boundaries for user-facing data
- execution trace inspection tooling is worker-owned, read-only operational tooling over `execution_*`; it does not create a public `v1` route, execute fresh verification, mutate cache eligibility, or bypass the public explain-route boundary
- manifest drift and proxy alerting tooling is worker-owned observation over `manifest_*`, `discovery_*`, code-hash facts, proxy / implementation edges, and derived watch targets; its live audit path may write only the worker-owned `manifest_alert_*` observation family, and its read-only inspection path renders those stored alert observations as operational JSON without writing adapter-owned `normalized_events`, mutating manifest truth, discovery admission, discovery edges, capability flags, watch-plan inputs, projections, alert lifecycle state, or public API state
