# Storage Strategy

Status: Phase 0 baseline

This document freezes the internal persistence strategy enough for storage, intake, projection, and execution work to proceed in parallel.

## 1. Invariants

- raw facts are immutable
- projections are disposable and rebuildable
- canonicality is explicit, never inferred from "latest row wins"
- verified execution artifacts are durable facts, not ephemeral cache only
- one write owner exists per storage family

## 2. Storage Layers

The system of record is split into six layers:

1. `chain_lineage`: block ancestry, fork points, hash-first reconciliation, head promotion
2. `raw_facts`: blocks, transactions, receipts, logs, code hashes, fetched call snapshots
3. `manifests_and_discovery`: source manifests, discovered edges, rollout flags
4. `identity_and_events`: `NameSurface`, `SurfaceBinding`, resources, token lineage, normalized events
5. `projections`: current-state and collection read models
6. `execution`: traces, cache entries, persisted verified outcomes

Only layers 1 through 5 are required to rebuild current declared state. Layer 6 is required to replay verified answers and explain them.

## 3. ID Strategy

### Deterministic text IDs

- `logical_name_id = "<namespace>:<normalized_name>"`

This is stable, human-auditable, and can be derived without database lookup.

### Opaque stable IDs

Use `uuid` for:

- `resource_id`
- `token_lineage_id`
- `contract_instance_id`
- `surface_binding_id`
- `execution_trace_id`

Rules:

- UUID values are internal identities, not user-generated strings
- `resource_id` and `token_lineage_id` must survive projection rebuilds
- token IDs, node hashes, and resolver addresses are attributes, not identity anchors

ENSv1 continuity rules for adapters:

- mint one `resource_id` per distinct ENSv1 authority anchor and reuse it if that exact anchor becomes authoritative again after a gap
- for this slice, direct registry-only control, registrar-backed registration, and wrapper-backed control are distinct ENSv1 authority anchors
- direct registry-only control has no active `token_lineage_id`
- mint one `token_lineage_id` per distinct tokenized ENSv1 anchor and reuse it if that same tokenized anchor becomes authoritative again
- transfer, renewal, fuse updates, and expiry / grace changes inside the same current anchor append normalized events but do not mint new `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, or `surface_binding_id` rows
- wrap, unwrap, and re-registration close the old binding range only when the authoritative anchor changes; unwrap back to the same still-live pre-wrap registrar lease reuses the prior registrar `resource_id` and `token_lineage_id`
- for ENSv1 direct-authority cases in this slice, write `SurfaceBinding.binding_kind = declared_registry_path`; do not use a different binding kind merely because the authority anchor changed between registry, registrar, and wrapper control

`contract_instance_id` rules:

- mint a new `contract_instance_id` when a manifest-declared contract or discovery-admitted contract first enters the canonical source graph
- one admitted contract address on one chain maps to one stable `contract_instance_id` across all admission epochs
- reuse the same `contract_instance_id` when the same contract address remains admitted on the same chain and only manifest version, rollout state, code-hash observations, or edge activity changes
- if the same admitted contract address becomes active again after an inactive gap, reuse the prior `contract_instance_id` and record a new non-overlapping active range instead of minting another ID
- model proxy contracts and implementation contracts as separate contract instances; proxy implementation churn mutates discovery edges and active ranges, not the proxy ID
- if the watched contract's own admitted address changes, close the old instance active range and mint a new `contract_instance_id`; do not reuse the prior ID to represent the successor deployment, and represent any continuity between distinct instances with `migration` edges
- store contract addresses as time-ranged attributes for raw-fact lookup, log routing, and watch-plan materialization; addresses are never the primary key of the source graph
- roots use the same `contract_instance_id` rules as ordinary manifest-declared and discovery-admitted contracts

### Append-only event IDs

Use `bigint generated always as identity` for:

- raw fact rows
- normalized event rows
- projection job rows

## 4. Table Families And Write Ownership

| Family | Write owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chain_*` | intake | lineage and canonical block graph |
| `raw_*` | intake | immutable blockchain and execution inputs |
| `manifest_*` | manifests/discovery | source manifests, declared contract admission, capability versions |
| `discovery_*` | manifests/discovery | canonical reachable contract graph and watch-plan expansion keyed by `contract_instance_id` |
| `name_surfaces`, `surface_bindings`, `resources`, `token_lineages` | adapters | stable identity anchors |
| `normalized_events` | adapters | append-only normalized protocol events |
| `projection_*` | projection workers | disposable read models |
| `execution_*` | execution workers | traces, cached answers, invalidations |

The API process is read-only against storage.

For ENSv1 identity rows, adapters are responsible for minting and reusing `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`, and `surface_binding_id` according to the continuity rules above. Projection workers consume those identity rows; they do not infer alternate continuity on their own.

At minimum, manifests/discovery persistence must carry:

- `contract_instances`: one row per stable `contract_instance_id` with chain, contract kind, and provenance; roots use the same identity family as other contract instances
- `contract_instance_addresses`: time-ranged address attributes keyed by `contract_instance_id` for lookup from raw facts and watch targets to source-graph identity; one `contract_instance_id` may carry multiple non-overlapping active ranges when the same address is re-admitted after an inactive gap
- `discovery_edges`: edges keyed by `edge_id` with `from_contract_instance_id`, `to_contract_instance_id`, `edge_kind`, active range, provenance, and canonicality
- any materialized watch-plan table keyed by `contract_instance_id` plus chain and range, including root start nodes keyed by the root `contract_instance_id`; raw address is a derived watch target, not the durable identity

## 5. Partitioning Baseline

Start with partitioning on the highest-volume append-only tables:

- `raw_blocks`
- `raw_transactions`
- `raw_receipts`
- `raw_logs`
- `normalized_events`
- `execution_steps`

Partition keys:

- `chain_id`
- block-number range

Current-state projection tables start unpartitioned unless measurements prove otherwise.

## 6. Canonicality Model

`chain_lineage` persists the recent reconciled block window keyed by `(chain_id, block_hash)` and carries the fields needed to recover canonical ancestry:

- `parent_hash`
- `block_number`
- `timestamp`
- checkpoint-promotion state
- integrity fields needed for audits and replay

Every fact-derived row that can be invalidated by reorg carries:

- `chain_id`
- `block_number`
- `block_hash`
- `canonicality_state`
- `observed_at`

`canonicality_state` values:

- `observed`
- `canonical`
- `safe`
- `finalized`
- `orphaned`

Rules:

- block hash is the identity anchor; block number is position only
- fork detection marks affected rows `orphaned`; it does not delete them
- projection rebuilds read rows that are `canonical`, `safe`, or `finalized` by default
- history and audit tools may opt into `observed` and `orphaned` rows explicitly
- safe and finalized promotion is monotonic per chain

## 7. Projection Storage Rules

Every current-state projection row carries:

- provenance pointers
- manifest version
- relevant chain positions
- canonicality summary
- last recomputed timestamp

Projection tables may be truncated and rebuilt from canonical facts plus normalized events.

## 8. Execution Artifact Storage

Persist small execution payloads inline in Postgres:

- request metadata
- response digests
- decoded final values
- failure reasons

Persist large payloads in object storage addressed by SHA-256 digest:

- CCIP payload bodies
- large metadata responses
- trace attachments

Postgres stores the digest, size, content type, and object key.

## 9. Migration Rules

- schema changes land through checked-in migrations only
- append-only tables prefer additive changes over destructive rewrites
- projection tables may be recreated when the rebuild path already exists
- migrations that change a shared interface require the companion doc update first

## 10. Repository Ownership Implications

To keep parallel work safe:

- storage owns migrations and query primitives
- adapters own inserts into identity and normalized-event tables
- projection workers own materialized read models
- execution workers own trace and cache tables
- API code must not query raw-fact tables directly except for explicit audit endpoints
