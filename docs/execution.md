# Verified Execution

Status: Phase 0 baseline

This document freezes the verified execution plane for resolution and primary-name verification.

## 1. Supported Entry Points

Initial verified entry points:

- explicit record resolution by name
- verified primary-name lookup by address and `coin_type`

The execution plane consumes:

- declared topology snapshots
- manifest versions
- requested chain positions

It does not read adapter-specific internals directly.

Mixed resolution and primary-name routes reuse one shared `ResultStatus` vocabulary:

- `success`
- `not_found`
- `mismatch`
- `unsupported`
- `invalid_name`
- `execution_failed`

Execution uses `ResultStatus` for verified route-local result objects, and the same vocabulary is reused by the paired declared primary-name claim object. The route contract decides which subset applies to each object.

## 2. Resolution Flow

Verified resolution follows this sequence:

1. load the declared topology for the requested surface and chain positions
2. choose the namespace-specific execution entrypoint
3. resolve resolver selection, alias rewrites, and wildcard traversal
4. execute onchain calls
5. follow CCIP-Read when allowed by the manifest and resolver family
6. hand off any admitted exact block-anchored call snapshots to intake-owned raw facts and persist the execution trace and final answer

For the namespace-inferred convenience route `GET /v1/resolve/{name}`, inference happens before step 1 and produces the canonical `{namespace, name}` tuple used by the rest of the flow:

- exact `base.eth` resolves as `namespace=ens`
- names matching `*.base.eth` resolve as `namespace=basenames`
- other supported ENS names resolve as `namespace=ens`

The inferred namespace is not execution-local metadata. It selects the declared topology, execution entrypoint, trace namespace, request key, provenance, and cache identity exactly as if the caller had used `GET /v1/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}`.

For ENS on Ethereum Mainnet, step 2 is frozen to the `ens_execution` source family. Its canonical manifest-declared execution entrypoint is the ENS Universal Resolver proxy: `[[contracts]] role = "universal_resolver"` at `0xeEeEEEeE14D718C2B47D9923Deab1335E144EeEe` (official ENS docs: https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/universal/). The pinned ENSv1 deployment artifact remains the implementation / ABI anchor behind that source family rather than the route-facing proxy address (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/UniversalResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/UniversalResolver.sol:L8 @ ens_v1@91c966f).

For Basenames on the shipped mainnet profile, step 2 is frozen to the `basenames_execution` source family. Its canonical manifest-declared execution entrypoint is the Basenames L1 Resolver: `[[contracts]] role = "l1_resolver"` at `0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc).

That Basenames execution owner shares the same L1 Resolver address with `basenames_l1_compat`, but the ownership split stays explicit: `basenames_l1_compat` owns transport attribution, while active `basenames_execution` v2 owns verified-resolution entrypoint selection with `verified_resolution=supported` only for one exact-surface transport-assisted direct-path class. The supported class requires `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` to equal top-level `data.logical_name_id`, `wildcard.source=null` with `matched_labels=[]`, `alias.final_target=null` with `hops=[]`, `subregistry_path=[]`, `transport.source_chain_id="base-mainnet"`, `transport.target_chain_id="ethereum-mainnet"`, and `transport.contract_address="0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31"`; all other Basenames verified / explain path classes remain explicit `unsupported`, and transport ownership stays with `basenames_l1_compat` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L69 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc).

The declared read plane stays separate from that Basenames execution / transport pairing: exact-name, address-name, and children reads remain sourced from the admitted Base registry / registrar / resolver families, while `basenames_base_primary` stays claim intake only (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L150 @ basenames@1809bbc).

Rules:

- every step is attributable in provenance
- one verified resolution request may cover multiple explicit record selectors under one request-scoped execution trace
- execution returns one `verified_queries` result object per requested selector and uses the shared `ResultStatus` vocabulary
- execution entrypoint selection is attributable to the manifest-declared `source_family` and `role`; it is not implied by registry-family presence alone
- wildcard traversal and alias rewriting must be explicit in the trace
- admitted exact block-anchored `raw_call_snapshots` stay intake-owned raw facts keyed by the exact requested chain position; execution may supply them only as a narrow persistence handoff for support classes that explicitly admit them, and they do not become execution-owned trace rows
- before persisting a selector-local verified result as a supported outcome eligible for cache reuse or public explain, execution must reload from storage the manifest versions for the request, the same declared topology snapshot the mixed route would serve for the same request and chain positions, and any resolver-profile admission state already required by the participating resolver-local fact families; the namespace support class is derived from those stored inputs rather than from transient trace shape alone
- if that stored revalidation cannot re-establish one frozen supported class, execution may persist audit trace material but must fail closed on supported-outcome persistence
- namespace inference and verified support are separate gates: inferred `namespace=basenames` requests never retry as `namespace=ens` outside the Basenames exact-surface transport-assisted direct-path support class
- unsupported record families stay explicit as `status=unsupported`; they do not silently degrade to declared cache values
- supported selector requests that cannot produce a trustworthy answer return `status=execution_failed` with a typed `failure_reason`

## 3. Primary-Name Verification Flow

Primary verification follows this sequence:

1. load the claimed name from the currently admitted declared claim surface
2. normalize the claimed name using the recorded normalizer version
3. resolve the claimed name for the requested `coin_type`
4. compare the resolved target with the requested address
5. persist both the claim state and verification result

Rules:

- the route keeps claimed state separate from the execution-derived verification result
- `claimed_primary_name` and `verified_primary_name` both use the shared `ResultStatus` vocabulary
- `claimed_primary_name` is limited to `success`, `not_found`, `unsupported`, and `invalid_name`; `verified_primary_name` is limited to `success`, `not_found`, `mismatch`, `unsupported`, `invalid_name`, and `execution_failed`
- a raw claim that cannot be normalized surfaces `status=invalid_name`; it is not silently treated as missing
- `raw_claim_name` is claim-local state: it may be preserved to explain `claimed_primary_name.status=invalid_name`, but it does not migrate into `verified_primary_name`
- `mismatch` and `execution_failed` are verified-only outcomes; when emitted, any `failure_reason` stays verification-local and does not duplicate declared claim identity
- `mismatch` means the claim normalized, resolved for the requested `coin_type`, and produced a concrete target address that did not equal the requested address
- when verification establishes a concrete normalized name target, `verified_primary_name` may carry that name identity for `status=success` or `status=mismatch`; it omits that identity for `status=not_found`, `status=unsupported`, `status=invalid_name`, and `status=execution_failed`
- claim-local provenance and verification-local provenance may both contribute to the route, but the claim-local side is exact-tuple declared provenance from the requested `primary_names_current(address, coin_type, namespace)` row and the shipped verification-local side is `verified_primary_name.provenance = {execution_trace_id, manifest_versions}` under the same top-level `provenance.execution_trace_id` for that exact tuple
- for ENS on Ethereum Mainnet in the current contract, the admitted declared claim surface is reverse-only: `ens_v1_reverse_l1` through contract role `reverse_registrar` at `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb` (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/ReverseRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L15 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L19 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L100 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L123 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- for Basenames on the shipped mainnet profile, the admitted declared primary-claim family is `basenames_base_primary` through contract role `reverse_registrar` at `0x79ea96012eea67a83431f1701b3dff7e37f9e282`; it remains claim intake only, so exact-name, address-name, and children declared truth stays on the Base registry / registrar / resolver families because upstream exposes reverse-name writes through the dedicated ReverseRegistrar rather than the Base authority stack (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L150 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- for ENS on Ethereum Mainnet, the verification step for that claimed name reuses the `ens_execution` source family and its manifest-declared `universal_resolver` proxy entrypoint at `0xeEeEEEeE14D718C2B47D9923Deab1335E144EeEe`; declared claim ownership and verified execution ownership stay separate (official ENS docs: https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/universal/) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L183 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L199 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L205 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L263 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L269 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- for Basenames as well as ENS, `claimed_primary_name` and `verified_primary_name` stay separate route-local objects: declared claim intake does not backfill verified identity, and Base authority reads plus the separate Ethereum Mainnet `L1Resolver` execution owner do not collapse them into one truth system (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `claimed_primary_name.name`, when present, comes only from the exact requested `primary_names_current(address, coin_type, namespace)` row's declared normalized claim-identity source for that same tuple, aligned with the currently admitted reverse-only claim precedence (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L100 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L123 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L129 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L130 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- it must not be synthesized or backfilled from manifest presence, resolver-backed identity, verified execution identity, tuple presence alone, a different tuple, or any fallback claim source
- `claimed_primary_name.name` remains distinct from execution-derived `verified_primary_name.name`; this clarification does not change when `verified_primary_name.name` appears, and it does not by itself widen the exact-tuple primary-name coverage contract
- that declared-vs-verified split means Phase 7 does not synthesize richer ENS `claimed_primary_name` payloads by combining reverse tuple intake with resolver-backed or execution-derived name identity; `claimed_primary_name.provenance` stays limited to exact-tuple declared row provenance, while deferred fallback-source expansion remains blocked
- the exact-tuple verified-primary support class is persisted readback only for the exact route tuple; the shipped ENS slice and the frozen first Basenames slice both use it, and the read path does not become a fresh execution entrypoint
- that exact-tuple support class uses stable execution identity `request_type=verified_primary_name`
- its `request key` identity is the exact normalized route tuple `{namespace}:{normalized_address}:{coin_type}`, where `normalized_address` uses the same lowercase normalization as `GET /v1/primary-names/{address}`; claimed text, normalized claim or verified name identity, verified target address, result status, and section-local provenance do not participate in that key
- that persisted-readback support class is also the only route-level primary-name coverage support class: ENS and Basenames exact tuples may publish `coverage.status=partial` with `exhaustiveness=non_enumerable` using the route's namespace-local claim and execution source families; route tuples outside the frozen classes remain explicit `unsupported` instead of inheriting coverage from manifest rollout, tuple presence, or verified-resolution support (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/ReverseRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/UniversalResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- `primary_names_current(address, coin_type, namespace)` is the claim-side lookup / invalidation anchor for that same tuple; projection-owned claim state may explain tuple admission or claim invalidation, but it must not persist `execution_trace_id` or `verified_primary_name`
- the public `claimed_primary_name.provenance` surface is exact-tuple declared-only provenance from that requested row; it must strip `verified_primary_name_lookup` / `verified_primary_name_invalidation` hook material and omit `execution_trace_id`
- the shipped `verified_primary_name.provenance` surface is limited to `execution_trace_id` and `manifest_versions`: it is a strict verification-local refinement for the same exact tuple, `verified_primary_name.provenance.execution_trace_id` must equal top-level `provenance.execution_trace_id`, and `verified_primary_name.provenance.manifest_versions` must narrow that same persisted verification trace
- `verified_primary_name.provenance` must not publish `verified_primary_name_lookup` / `verified_primary_name_invalidation` hook material, restate claimed-row provenance, or introduce a second lookup / invalidation identity for the tuple
- the shipped Phase 7 ENS primary-name path still does not require dedicated manifest capability flags such as `claimed_primary_name` or `verified_primary_name`; reverse claim admission stays owned by the active `ens_v1_reverse_l1` manifest, while verified-primary readback stays execution-derived under the already frozen `ens_execution` owner (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/ReverseRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L100 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L123 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- the frozen first Basenames exact-tuple verified-primary slice likewise does not require a dedicated manifest capability flag; reverse claim admission stays owned by `basenames_base_primary`, while verified-primary readback stays execution-derived under the already frozen `basenames_execution` owner because upstream keeps reverse-name writes on the Base ReverseRegistrar while the separate Ethereum Mainnet `L1Resolver` remains the execution entrypoint (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L193 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- top-level route provenance joins claim-side and verification-side context; section-local provenance stays narrower, `claimed_primary_name.provenance` stays row-scoped and declared-only, and `verified_primary_name.provenance`, when present, stays verification-local under that same persisted `execution_trace_id`
- missing or unsupported ENS reverse claims do not trigger fallback to registry-, resolver-, or other claim-setting surfaces in this phase; the admitted ENS claim source is the reverse registrar tuple only (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L74 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L83 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L84 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- manifest rollout and capability state remain source-family-local inputs only: they may admit reverse claim intake or shadow execution traces and cache ownership, but they do not by themselves widen ENS claim precedence, widen route-level primary-name coverage beyond the exact-tuple persisted-readback class, or ship richer tuple-present `claimed_primary_name` or `verified_primary_name` payloads (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L74 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L83 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L84 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- introducing any dedicated primary-name manifest capability flag would therefore be a later additive contract change, not a prerequisite for the shipped persisted-readback or reverse-claim slices
- the shipped route may still return explicit verified `status=unsupported` outside the frozen exact-tuple persisted-readback class without surfacing richer tuple-present claimed or verified payloads

## 4. Trace Schema

Each verified answer persists:

- `execution_trace_id`
- request type
- request key
- namespace
- chain positions
- manifest versions
- step list
- contracts called
- gateway digests
- final value
- failure reason
- finished timestamp

For resolution, one persisted answer may include multiple selector-scoped outputs under the same `execution_trace_id`.

For the exact-tuple verified-primary support class, one persisted answer covers exactly one `{address, namespace, coin_type}` tuple under `request_type=verified_primary_name`.

Each step records:

- step index
- step kind
- input digest
- output digest
- latency
- canonicality dependency

Admitted exact block-anchored `raw_call_snapshots` are not part of this trace schema. They remain intake-owned raw facts keyed by exact block identity even when a verified-resolution persistence path hands them off alongside the trace.

Execution traces and execution steps are durable audit artifacts. Reorg-driven cache invalidation must not delete `execution_traces`, `execution_steps`, object-store attachments, or the trace-local step list; it only changes whether a persisted verified outcome can be reused as a cache hit.

### Worker Trace Inspection

`bigname-worker inspect execution-trace --execution-trace-id <id> --json` is the worker-owned operational inspection surface for one persisted execution trace.

The stable JSON output is limited to already persisted trace and step state:

- `command`
- `execution_trace_id`
- request metadata already stored on the trace
- request type and request key
- namespace
- chain positions
- manifest versions
- trace status, final value digest, failure reason, and finished timestamp
- ordered `steps` entries with step index, step kind, input digest, output digest, latency, canonicality dependency, and attachment digest metadata where present

Rules:

- the command reads `execution_traces`, `execution_steps`, and trace attachment metadata only
- it does not execute or re-execute resolution, primary-name verification, CCIP calls, or topology discovery
- it does not expose a public `v1` route, raw execution API, raw gateway transcript API, or batch trace dump
- it does not synthesize declared topology, resolver paths, wildcard paths, alias paths, or transport paths from non-trace storage
- it does not mutate `execution_cache_outcomes`, projections, manifests, discovery edges, watch plans, or normalized events
- it preserves the public explain boundary: `GET /v1/explain/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}/execution` remains the route-local explain view over persisted supported resolution traces, while this command is operational read-only inspection

## 5. Cache Key And Invalidation

Persisted verified outcomes are cached in `execution_cache_outcomes` by:

- request key
- requested chain positions
- manifest versions
- topology version boundary
- record version boundary

Invalidate on:

- reorg
- manifest change
- resolver change
- alias or wildcard topology change
- relevant record change
- primary claim change

For resolution, `request key` includes the normalized explicit selector set so the cache boundary matches `verified_queries`.

For `GET /v1/resolve/{name}`, the resolution request key is built from the inferred namespace, normalized name, and normalized explicit selector set. A namespace-inferred request and the equivalent canonical `GET /v1/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}` request therefore share cache identity after inference; the raw convenience path string is not a separate cache namespace.

For verified primary-name, `request key` is the normalized tuple string `{namespace}:{normalized_address}:{coin_type}`. The matching `primary_names_current(address, coin_type, namespace)` row is the only admitted claim-side lookup / invalidation anchor for that key; projection updates for that row may invalidate request-matching verified answers, but the projection does not persist verified result payloads or trace IDs.

Phase 9 reorg invalidation rules:

- reorg repair invalidates any `execution_cache_outcomes` row for verified resolution or verified primary-name readback whose dependency set contains an orphaned block identity
- cache dependencies must be tied to explicit block-hash-bearing chain positions or boundaries; block numbers, `latest` / `head` tags, manifest versions, topology versions, and record versions are not sufficient unless they resolve to one or more block hashes or to source rows that carry block hashes
- verified resolution and verified primary-name rows without explicit block-hash-bearing dependencies fail closed and are ineligible for cache reuse after a reorg check; request types that are documented as not depending on chain state remain explicitly out of scope rather than implicitly safe
- invalidation affects cache eligibility only; execution traces, execution steps, and trace attachments remain durable audit artifacts
- this is a reorg/replay foundation only: it does not promote ENSv2 exact-name support, widen any verified support class, or graduate any manifest capability

## 6. Explain Requirements

Every verified answer must be explainable through:

- selected entrypoint
- resolver discovery path
- wildcard traversal
- alias rewriting
- CCIP steps
- final comparison or returned record value

For resolution, the shipped explain surface is `GET /v1/explain/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}/execution`.

Rules:

- it is keyed by the same current exact surface and explicit selector set as `GET /v1/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}`
- it reads the persisted execution trace and selector-scoped results already stored for that request; it does not re-execute the request or synthesize explain detail from declared topology alone
- top-level provenance and any selector-local provenance stay anchored to the same persisted `execution_trace_id`
- the route surfaces the selected entrypoint, resolver discovery path, wildcard traversal, alias rewriting, and the ordered persisted step summary; CCIP-Read participation appears through persisted step kinds rather than a raw gateway transcript
- it does not become a global trace-inspection API, a raw trace dump, or a second provenance / truth system
- it is shipped and published in `docs/api-v1.openapi.json`; the current handler contract exposes path parameters plus required `records` only
- public explain support stays coupled to the same verified-resolution support boundary as the mixed route; deferred unsupported path classes do not gain a synthetic trace-shaped public contract
- for Basenames, the public execution-explain support boundary applies only to execution explain; the separate declared exact-name explain routes stay on the Base-side declared read plane (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc)

## 7. Initial Support Boundary

For the shipped Phase 7 slice:

- ENS verified resolution on Ethereum Mainnet uses `ens_execution` with contract role `universal_resolver` at the official ENS Universal Resolver proxy address `0xeEeEEEeE14D718C2B47D9923Deab1335E144EeEe`; the shipped public verified slice covers exact-surface direct-path requests first, the already frozen exact-surface alias-only non-direct class, and the first additive exact-surface wildcard-derived class (official ENS docs: https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/universal/) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L90 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/universalResolver/AbstractUniversalResolver.sol:L106 @ ens_v1@91c966f)
- for that support check, use the same declared topology snapshot as the mixed route: a request is direct-path only when `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` equals top-level `data.logical_name_id`, `wildcard.source` is `null` with `matched_labels=[]`, `alias.final_target` is `null` with `hops=[]`, and all `transport` fields are `null`
- the already frozen ENS alias-only non-direct support class is the exact-surface class where that same declared topology snapshot keeps `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` equal to top-level `data.logical_name_id`, `alias.final_target` is non-`null` with `hops` non-empty, `wildcard.source` is `null` with `matched_labels=[]`, and all `transport` fields are `null`
- the first additive ENS wildcard-derived support class is the exact-surface class where `wildcard.source` is non-`null` with `matched_labels` non-empty, `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` equals `wildcard.source.logical_name_id`, `alias.final_target` is `null` with `hops=[]`, `subregistry_path=[]`, and all `transport` fields are `null`
- supported direct-path, alias-only, and wildcard-derived answers remain attributable through the same persisted execution trace and explain contract: the public explain route must surface the selected entrypoint, resolver discovery path, ordered persisted steps, and the participating alias or wildcard detail for that persisted answer without inventing a second trace family
- ENS verified requests outside the direct-path, alias-only, and wildcard-derived classes, including other non-alias ancestor-selected paths, linked-subregistry ancestor-selected paths, any transport-assisted path, and any request whose persisted execution used CCIP-Read, remain deferred and return explicit selector-local `status=unsupported` on the mixed route; the shipped explain route does not synthesize public traces for them
- Basenames verified resolution on the shipped mainnet profile uses active `basenames_execution` v2 with contract role `l1_resolver` at `0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31`; `basenames_l1_compat` owns that same L1 Resolver address as compatibility transport, and public Basenames verified / explain support is limited to the exact-surface transport-assisted direct-path class rather than a transport-free or authority-replacing class (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L69 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- that supported Basenames class uses the same declared-topology snapshot as the mixed route: `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` equals top-level `data.logical_name_id`, `wildcard.source` is `null` with `matched_labels=[]`, `alias.final_target` is `null` with `hops=[]`, `subregistry_path=[]`, `transport.source_chain_id="base-mainnet"`, `transport.target_chain_id="ethereum-mainnet"`, and `transport.contract_address="0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31"` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L69 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- CCIP-participating traces are eligible for that supported Basenames class rather than selector-local `status=unsupported` because the upstream `L1Resolver` initiates `OffchainLookup` for non-`base.eth` requests and completes them through `resolveWithProof`; the explain route must therefore surface the resulting persisted CCIP steps for that class without inventing a second trace family (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L154 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L173 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L191 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- Basenames paths outside that frozen transport-assisted direct class remain explicit `unsupported`, and the verified-resolution support class still does not widen route-level primary-name coverage beyond the separate exact-tuple persisted-readback class or add a new manifest flag; the first Basenames `verified_primary_name` support class on `GET /v1/primary-names/{address}` is instead that exact-tuple class under the same reverse-intake / execution split (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `GET /v1/resolve/{name}` does not widen this support boundary: exact `base.eth` is inferred as `namespace=ens`, names matching `*.base.eth` are inferred as `namespace=basenames`, and inferred Basenames verified selectors return selector-local `status=unsupported` unless the requested snapshot satisfies the same frozen transport-assisted direct-path Basenames support class
- ENS and Basenames primary-name coverage has graduated only for the local exact-tuple persisted-readback class: supported tuples may return route-level `coverage.status=partial` with `exhaustiveness=non_enumerable`; unfrozen tuples, fallback claim sources, richer claimed payloads, fresh verified-primary execution, and namespace-wide or app-parity claims remain explicit `unsupported` or out of scope. Manifest rollout, manifest capability state, reverse tuple lookup, and resolver-backed verification detail do not by themselves widen that exact-tuple public contract, and any fallback beyond the currently admitted claim surface remains deferred (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/ReverseRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/UniversalResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- unsupported resolver families remain requestable but must return explicit `status=unsupported` results unless the route cannot attribute any section-level answer at all
