# API Surface Flattening Scope Decisions

Working sheet behind ADR 0003. These answers informed the API surface flattening plan; the accepted contract remains the checked-in public docs and ADRs.

Legend:

- `Yes` means keep or adopt the capability.
- `No` means delete, hide, or make it internal.
- `Unsure` means decide before implementation.

## Core Product Shape

### 1. Should bigname expose only current/latest state?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: delete public `at`, `chain_positions`, `consistency`; keep only latest checkpoint semantics; large snapshot/test savings.
- [X] No
  - Deletes/narrows: keep time-travel/current-at-snapshot API; snapshot selection remains a core product surface.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

Time-travel queries are good, what is `consistency` though?


### 2. Should bigname expose historical events?

- [X] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: keep `/history/*` and `/events`; normalized events stay public-facing.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: normalized events become internal replay data only; delete public history/event handlers and docs.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:


### 3. Should bigname expose audit/provenance data publicly?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: keep route provenance and derivation detail in responses.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: move provenance to internal/audit tooling; public DTOs shrink substantially.
- [X] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

What audit/provenance data is there? What does it do?


### 4. Should bigname expose coverage/exhaustiveness publicly?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: keep coverage/exhaustiveness/support taxonomy as public contract.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: collapse to ordinary nulls/errors/availability; removes lots of support-shaping code.
- [X] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

What coverage/exhaustiveness policies do we have?


### 5. Should bigname have exactly one public response envelope?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: pick one envelope for all public routes; deletes full/compact dual response paths.
- [X] No
  - Deletes/narrows: continue carrying compact app DTOs plus full/audit envelopes.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:


## Records

### 6. Should records be indexed-only?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: records come only from indexed projections/cache; no API execution needed for values.
- [X] No
  - Deletes/narrows: keep verified/live/persisted execution as part of records product.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

What is the persisted execution used for? Where?


### 7. Should the public API return record inventory?

- [X] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: record selector inventory remains visible to clients.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: inventory becomes internal; public API returns values/status only.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:


### 8. Should the public API return record cache metadata?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: cache boundaries/status/provenance stay visible.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: cache metadata becomes internal; public record output is value-oriented.
- [X] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

What is in the record cache metadata?


### 9. Should unknown, unobserved, and unsupported record selectors remain distinct publicly?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: keep precise `not_found` vs `pending` vs `unsupported` semantics.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: collapse these to missing/unavailable; simpler client and server model.
- [X] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

What does this mean?

### 10. Should text-value hydration exist?

- [X] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: keep or fold hydration into rebuild; supports filling observed ENSv1 text values.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: delete hydration sidecar and CLI knobs; record cache only reflects indexed values.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:


## Execution

### 11. Should API requests ever call RPC providers live?

- [X] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: API can perform live RPC work; needs provider config, error/stale paths, latency concerns.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: API is read-only over stored projections/execution output; simpler and more predictable.
- [ ] Unsure
  - Decide before coding; this affects docs and implementation scope.

Notes:

We should also have RPC fallback/etc, for failover, redundancy, and optionally, correctness.


### 12. Should execution traces be public?

- [ ] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: keep public explain/execution trace routes.
- [ ] No
  - Deletes/narrows: execution traces become internal debugging artifacts only.

Notes:


### 17. Should resolver profile completeness be public?

- [X] Yes
  - Keeps/adopts: publish supported/pending/unsupported profile completeness.

## Final Direction

Proposed in [ADR 0006](../adrs/0006-api-v2-product-surface.md) (2026-06-10).
The ADR is `Status: Proposed`: nothing below is decided until it is accepted,
and implementation does not start before acceptance (ADR 0006 § Rollout
step 1). The checkbox states above are the original survey; the ADR
supersedes them on acceptance. Summary of the proposed direction:

Chosen product shape:

- A new product surface (developed under the `/v2` prefix, shipped as the
  re-baselined `v1`) with three tiers: lookup primitives (`POST /lookup`,
  `/status`), product reads in one envelope (`data`/`page`/`meta`) and one
  naming dictionary, and `/diagnostics/*` as the only home of pipeline
  vocabulary.
- The API-scope `Unsure` items above are resolved in ADR 0006 § "What this ADR
  deliberately keeps" (Q3, Q4, Q5, Q8, Q9, Q12, Q20, Q31, Q33, Q34, Q37, Q39,
  Q40); Q32's earlier `Yes` is superseded (`meta=full` does not survive on
  product routes). Q36 (raw-fact retention) is storage policy, not API
  surface — it stays open and is not decided by ADR 0006.

Must keep:

- Snapshot-pinned reads (`at` + `finality`), `stale`/`conflict` canonicality
  semantics, verified execution behind `source=`, explicit unsupported
  semantics (`meta.completeness`, `unsupported_fields`, per-item `status`).

Can delete:

- `view`, `mode`/`declared_state`/`verified_state` (renamed `source`, no
  parallel trees), `meta=full` on product routes, dead wire fields
  (`resource_hex`, `role_bitmap`, `authority_epoch`, `verification_failed`),
  reserved/rejected parameters, `/v1/resources/*` + roles routes (merged into
  permissions), `/v1/manifests/*` (merged into namespaces), `profiles/` prefix.

Needs docs-first change:

- `docs/api-v2.md`, `docs/api-v2-routes.md`, generated
  `docs/api-v2.openapi.json`; `docs/api-v1.md` frozen except corrections;
  `docs/consumer-capabilities.md` remapped to `v2`.

Implementation order:

- Per ADR 0006 § Rollout: accept ADR → write new contract docs → implement
  under the `/v2` development prefix over the existing read layer (ADR 0003
  slices 3–6 as enablers) → conformance tests → one-time parity validation
  (capability mapping, same-snapshot value equivalence, partner latency) →
  switch: delete old v1 and rename `/v2` to `/v1` (public API stays at v1; no
  permanent v2 prefix) → point partner-1 shim and app at the re-baselined v1.
