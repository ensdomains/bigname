# Production Docker Runbook

This runbook is for operating the single-host Docker production stack from a
server checkout. General deployment shape is documented in
[`../deployment.md`](../deployment.md), public edge details in
[`../production.md`](../production.md), and current non-secret host notes in
[`../production-current-host.md`](../production-current-host.md).

Do not commit `.env.server`, provider URLs, passwords, tokens, private IPs, or
cloud credentials.

## Compose Command

Run commands from the repository root:

```sh
cd /home/ubuntu/bigname
```

For the current same-host Reth setup, use both compose files:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  ps
```

If operating the public edge, add `-f docker-compose.public.yml` to commands
that need Caddy.

## Preflight

Before long bootstrap, replay, migration, or rebuild work:

```sh
df -h / /var/lib/docker /home/ubuntu/bigname
free -h
docker system df
docker stats --no-stream
docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} {{.RestartCount}} {{.State.Status}} {{.State.OOMKilled}} {{.State.Error}}' \
  bigname-api-1 bigname-indexer-1 bigname-worker-1 bigname-postgres-1
```

The current host notes define a `100G` free-space floor for writable disk during
bootstrap and finalized catch-up. Pause range work before crossing that floor.

## Start Or Refresh

For the configured image tag in `.env.server`:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  up -d
```

For a local emergency build from the checkout:

```sh
docker build -t bigname:local .

BIGNAME_IMAGE=bigname:local docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  up --force-recreate migrate

BIGNAME_IMAGE=bigname:local docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  up -d --force-recreate api worker indexer
```

Prefer committing or clearly recording the source revision before running a
local image on production. A local tag is convenient, but it is not a durable
release identifier by itself.

## Pause And Resume

To pause chain intake and normalized replay:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  stop indexer
```

To freeze [projection](../glossary.md) writes as well:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  stop worker
```

Leave Postgres running unless the maintenance requires a database stop. Leave
Reth and Lighthouse running when possible so the node does not need a long
catch-up later. The API may stay up for reads if Postgres is healthy and the
operator is comfortable serving the current projection state.

Resume:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  up -d worker indexer
```

## Monitoring

Process and resource checks:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  ps

docker stats --no-stream \
  bigname-api-1 bigname-indexer-1 bigname-worker-1 bigname-postgres-1 \
  eth-archive-node-reth-1 eth-archive-node-lighthouse-1

curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz
```

Recent logs:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  logs --tail=200 indexer

docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  logs --tail=200 worker
```

Database activity:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T postgres psql -U bigname -d bigname -P pager=off -c "
SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS age, state, wait_event_type, wait_event,
       left(regexp_replace(query, '\s+', ' ', 'g'), 240) AS query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database()
  AND state <> 'idle'
ORDER BY query_start;"
```

Chain checkpoints:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T postgres psql -U bigname -d bigname -P pager=off -c "
SELECT chain_id, canonical_block_number, safe_block_number,
       finalized_block_number, updated_at
FROM chain_checkpoints
ORDER BY chain_id;"
```

Normalized replay cursor:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T postgres psql -U bigname -d bigname -P pager=off -c "
SELECT deployment_profile, chain_id, cursor_kind,
       next_block_number, target_block_number, last_completed_block_number,
       last_replayed_at, last_failure_at,
       left(last_failure_reason, 240) AS last_failure_reason
FROM normalized_replay_cursors
ORDER BY deployment_profile, chain_id, cursor_kind;"
```

Name-surface normalizer repair status:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T postgres psql -U bigname -d bigname -P pager=off -c "
SELECT normalizer_version, count(*)
FROM name_surfaces
GROUP BY normalizer_version
ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

SELECT expected_normalizer_version, finding_kind, count(*)
FROM name_surface_normalization_repair_findings
GROUP BY expected_normalizer_version, finding_kind
ORDER BY expected_normalizer_version, finding_kind;"
```

After deploying a normalizer change and running migrations, apply only compatible
retained-surface metadata from the existing indexer container:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T indexer bigname-indexer repair name-surface-normalization \
    --apply-compatible \
    --record-findings
```

This command does not rewrite `logical_name_id` or identity-defining hash fields.
Rows that reject or remap under the active normalizer remain unchanged and are
recorded in `name_surface_normalization_repair_findings` for a separate
semantic repair decision. Each compatible update transaction also advances the
full-replay input revision, so a worker cannot resume or publish a durable
projection stage built from the earlier metadata; completion markers and an
automatic replay attempt from that revision are invalidated in the same
transaction.

Because compatible repair may refresh retained surface display metadata, replay
all current projections before declaring the repair complete:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T worker bigname-worker replay all-current-projections
```

The manual command acquires the same cross-process replay lock as automatic
bootstrap and fails immediately with an `automatic replay owns the
cross-process replay lock` error when that replay is active. Let automatic
replay finish, or stop the worker before rerunning the command; do not run both
against the same database. Once admitted, the command resumes the persisted
attempt target when one exists, otherwise records the current normalized-replay
and chain-checkpoint head, and writes that real target on its family completion
markers so automatic handoff can consume them.

The live identity validation checks for stale display rows in the API-readable
current projections and identity-feed [sidecar](../glossary.md) after this replay.

Backfill and projection apply:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  exec -T postgres psql -U bigname -d bigname -P pager=off -c "
SELECT status, count(*) FROM backfill_jobs GROUP BY status ORDER BY status;
SELECT status, count(*) FROM backfill_ranges GROUP BY status ORDER BY status;
SELECT cursor_name, last_change_id, updated_at FROM projection_apply_cursors;
SELECT projection,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE claim_token IS NULL) AS pending,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE claim_token IS NOT NULL) AS claimed,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE last_failure_reason IS NOT NULL) AS failed
FROM projection_invalidations
GROUP BY projection
ORDER BY projection;"
```

## Synced Criteria

Treat the stack as fully synced only when all of these are true:

- indexer and worker are running without fresh restarts or OOM kills
- chain checkpoints continue advancing near the configured provider or Reth head
- bootstrap/backfill ranges have no unexpected `failed`, `reserved`, or long
  running stale rows
- normalized replay has `next_block_number > target_block_number` and no
  `last_failure_reason`
- projection invalidations have drained, with no failed invalidations
- API health is ready
- disk, RAM, swap, and CPU remain within the host budget

After a repair, keep monitoring for at least one to two hours after all of the
above are true, not merely after the first successful restart.

## Failure Handling

When a failure appears, capture the broad state before restarting:

```sh
docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} {{.RestartCount}} {{.State.Status}} {{.State.OOMKilled}} {{.State.Error}} {{.State.FinishedAt}}' \
  bigname-api-1 bigname-indexer-1 bigname-worker-1 bigname-postgres-1

docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  logs --tail=300 indexer

docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  logs --tail=300 worker
```

For [normalized-event](../glossary.md) mismatch failures, stop the indexer before retry loops
generate noise. Decide whether the fix is code, a data repair migration, or
both. If a migration changes normalized event [canonicality](../glossary.md) or identity fields,
it must also enqueue projection invalidation through
`projection_normalized_event_changes`.
