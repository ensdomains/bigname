# Deployment

The production container image contains the three runnable bigname binaries:

- `bigname-api`
- `bigname-indexer`
- `bigname-worker`

The image entrypoint accepts one service selector:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest api
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest indexer
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest worker
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest migrate
```

The default command is `api`. Raw binary invocations are also supported:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest bigname-api print-openapi
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest bigname-worker inspect watch-plan --json
```

## Fresh Server Compose

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Copy `.env.server.example` to `.env.server` and change the placeholder passwords.
3. Set `BIGNAME_IMAGE` to the image tag to run.
4. Start the stack:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.server -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d
```

The server compose file starts PostgreSQL, MinIO, a one-shot migration service,
the API, the indexer, and the worker. The API listens on the host port from
`BIGNAME_API_PORT` and answers readiness at `/healthz`.

The indexer loads exactly one manifest root. Use `/app/manifests` for the
mainnet profile or `/app/manifests-sepolia-dev` for the ENSv2 Sepolia dev
profile. Do not point one runtime at both manifest roots.

If `BIGNAME_INDEXER_CHAIN_RPC_URLS` is unset, the indexer still syncs
manifest/watch state, but provider-backed live ingestion remains idle. Current
bootstrap RPC support accepts `http://` endpoints.

The API service also needs its own Ethereum JSON-RPC provider for live ENS
verified resolution, configured as
`BIGNAME_API_CHAIN_RPC_URLS=ethereum-mainnet=<http-url>`. `GET /v1/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}` and
`GET /v1/resolve/{name}` in `mode=verified|both` first use matching persisted
execution output; when supported ENS verified-resolution selectors are missing
from execution storage, the API executes them against the selected exact-name
snapshot, persists the trace/outcome, and then returns the result. With no `at`
or `chain_positions` selector, that target is `consistency=head` at the latest
stored Ethereum checkpoint, not provider latest. Missing API provider
configuration or a provider that cannot serve the selected block must fail
closed with `409 stale` plus a configuration message; it must not fall back
to declared record cache. The indexer RPC setting and Reth DB source settings do
not satisfy this API live-execution provider requirement by themselves.

Deployments with a same-host Reth database can layer
`docker-compose.reth-db.yml` on top of the server compose file. Set
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DATADIR_HOST` to the host Reth datadir,
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DATADIR_CONTAINER` to the in-container mount path, and
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_CHAIN_RETH_DB_SOURCES` to comma-delimited `<chain>=<path>`
entries that use that in-container path. The override clears
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_CHAIN_RPC_URLS` for the indexer so each chain still has only
one provider source. Reth DB sources remain operational intake sources; they do
not replace bigname raw facts or normalized-event `raw_fact_ref` identities.
The repository Dockerfile builds `bigname-indexer` with the
`bigname-indexer/reth-db` Cargo feature so this override keeps the Reth provider
path available. Custom images that omit that feature fail fast when
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_CHAIN_RETH_DB_SOURCES` is set, with a rebuild instruction
instead of silently falling back to JSON-RPC or dropping the provider.
The indexer opens the Reth database through Reth's read-only provider API, but
the container mount is writable because MDBX cooperative read-only opens still
need writable lock/coordination files in the datadir.
The override defaults the indexer to `BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DB_USER=0:0` because
container-managed Reth datadirs are commonly `root:root`; operators may set a
less-privileged UID/GID after granting that identity write access to
the Reth datadir's MDBX lock files. The override also raises `nofile` because
Reth's read-only RocksDB provider can keep thousands of SST files open.
It bypasses the image's `tini` entrypoint so the indexer process owns PID 1;
Reth's live MDBX read-only open can fail from the default `tini` child process.
High-volume bootstrap defaults to
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_HASH_PINNED_BACKFILL_ADAPTER_SYNC=auto`. In `auto` mode,
hash-pinned backfill chunks use the manifest-declared/raw catch-up scope while
the indexer is catching up, live polling keeps new block-derived events current,
and the indexer also runs automatic bounded raw-fact normalized-event replay
from its `normalized_replay_*` cursor until historical normalized events reach
the persisted raw-log head. Broad manifest-observation, discovery-refresh, and
discovery-emitter adapter sync stay outside the live tailer. Operators may set
`raw-only` to defer live normalized sync manually, or `inline` to replay each
chunk immediately for small ranges and enable broad runtime refreshes.

```sh
BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DATADIR_HOST=/var/lib/reth \
BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DATADIR_CONTAINER=/reth-data \
BIGNAME_INDEXER_CHAIN_RETH_DB_SOURCES=ethereum-mainnet=/reth-data \
BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DB_USER=0:0 \
BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DB_NOFILE_SOFT=1048576 \
BIGNAME_INDEXER_RETH_DB_NOFILE_HARD=1048576 \
docker compose --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml \
  -f docker-compose.reth-db.yml \
  up -d indexer
```

RPC requirements are per selected profile and active watched chain. An
Ethereum-only run may omit Base entirely. If the selected profile includes Base
but no Base RPC is configured, Base provider-backed intake, automatic bootstrap,
backfill catch-up, and live head following stay idle with an explicit
`no_provider` / unavailable operational state; startup for configured chains
must not fail solely because Base is missing. A provider entry for a chain that
is not part of the selected manifest root is invalid.

Startup bootstrap creates finite backfill jobs from each eligible target's
manifest/discovery admitted start through the provider head observed at job
creation time. It does not cap work to a recent window. This is still
operational intake work: completing bootstrap alone is not consumer-replacement
or route-coverage evidence without the relevant projection, route, conformance,
and rollout gates.

Hash-pinned backfill execution batches each reserved range into
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_HASH_PINNED_BACKFILL_CHUNK_BLOCKS`-sized chunks. The default
server profile uses `1024` blocks. Larger chunks reduce checkpoint churn and RPC
round trips during long historical bootstrap, while also increasing the amount
of range work retried after a failed chunk. Raw-only sparse backfill also caps
each materialized push with
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_HASH_PINNED_BACKFILL_MAX_LOGS_PER_PUSH` so dense log spans are
split before transaction and receipt fetch/persist work. The older
`BIGNAME_INDEXER_HASH_PINNED_BACKFILL_MAX_LOGS_PER_RANGE` name is still accepted
as a fallback.
Automatic normalized-event replay catch-up keeps its block cursor, but also caps
each replay chunk with `BIGNAME_INDEXER_NORMALIZED_REPLAY_CATCHUP_MAX_LOGS_PER_CHUNK`
so sparse eras can move in large block jumps while dense spans are bounded by
the number of persisted raw logs replayed. The automatic cursor is one
all-source chain cursor over persisted canonical raw facts; source-scoped replay
is reserved for explicit repair/backfill runs.
Use `RUST_LOG=info,sqlx::query=error` for these runs; otherwise SQLx slow-query
warnings can print huge generated INSERT statements for dense chunks and waste
time on logging instead of ingest.

Operational catch-up to finalized head should be run as bounded idempotent
backfill chunks. Before every chunk starts range work, check current Postgres
size, writable free disk, and any configured object-cache budget. Capacity
shortage should pause or fail the chunk explicitly instead of silently retaining
less selected replay data or retaining full payload bundles for empty historical
blocks.

## GHCR Image

The repository publishes the image to:

```text
ghcr.io/tateb/bigname
```

The GitHub Actions workflow publishes `latest` on the default branch and a short
commit SHA tag on every push to `main`. Tags pushed to the repository are also
published with the same tag name.

Manual publish from an authenticated checkout:

```sh
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:latest \
  -t ghcr.io/tateb/bigname:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  --push .
```
