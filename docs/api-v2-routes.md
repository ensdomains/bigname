# API v2 Routes

Per-route reference for the development-time `/v2` surface accepted in
[ADR 0006](adrs/0006-api-v2-product-surface.md). Contract principles,
dictionary, envelope, status vocabulary, finality rules, cursor rules, and
error shape live in [`api-v2.md`](api-v2.md).

Routes below use the `/v2` development prefix. At the switch, the prefix
becomes `/v1`; no permanent public `/v2` prefix ships.

`GET /healthz`, `GET /`, `GET /docs`, and `GET /openapi.json` remain
non-contract helpers.

## Shared Route Rules

Name-shaped routes infer the namespace from the name itself: exact `base.eth`
is `ens` because upstream treats it as the L1 root domain handled by the
Mainnet L1Resolver (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc)
(upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L154 @ basenames@1809bbc);
`*.base.eth` is `basenames`, the Base-issued subdomain space
(upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc); other
supported names are `ens`. Name-shaped routes accept optional `namespace` as
an override and always echo the resolved `namespace` in the response.

Single-resource GETs return `404 not_found` when no answer exists. Collections
return `200` with empty `data` when the result set is known-empty. Batch lookup
uses in-band result `status` and never returns `404` for one missing input. The
primary-name route is the documented single-resource exception: valid tuples
with no claim, unsupported verification, or mismatched verification return
`200` with in-band `status`.

All collection routes use the standard `page` object: `cursor`,
`next_cursor`, `page_size`, nullable `total_count`, and `has_more`.

Field ownership:

- Shared record, lookup, primary-name, event, and count concepts are dictionary
  fields in `api-v2.md`.
- Lookup-only transport fields are route-local: `id` is caller correlation
  inside the echoed `input`, `kind` is the result discriminator, `profile` and
  `inputs` are request controls, `record` holds a single name result, `records`
  holds reverse result rows, and `changed`, `input_name`, and `reason` live
  inside `normalization` only.
- Name-filter request fields are route-local: `q` is shared by search and
  address-name collections, `match` is search-only, and `dedupe` is
  address-name-only.
- Records-route containers are route-local: `records`, `inventory`,
  `known_keys`, `unset_keys`, `unsupported_keys`, and `value` are the per-key
  answer and inventory shape for one resolver-record route, not shared domain
  vocabulary.
- Permission lineage containers are route-local: `lineage`, `grant`,
  `revocation`, `inheritance_path`, and `transfer_behavior` exist only on
  `include=lineage` for `/v2/permissions`.
- Primary-name containers are route-local: `answers` holds the returned
  source answer entries, and `raw_claim_name` preserves an invalid reverse
  claim exactly as observed for that tuple.
- Role-summary containers are route-local: `grants` groups
  `{grant_scope, powers}` entries under one `address` inside
  `role_summary`.
- Namespace metadata containers are route-local: `networks` is the
  product-facing list of public chain mappings for one namespace.
- Resolver overview containers are route-local: `bound_names` is the nested
  names collection inside one resolver overview object.
- Ops status containers are route-local: `/v2/status` owns `chains`,
  `latest_block`, `indexed_block`, `safe_block`, `finalized_block`,
  `lag_blocks`, and `lag_seconds`.
- Diagnostic-only field names are route-local to diagnostics unless they are
  already dictionary fields. Diagnostics may use pipeline vocabulary because
  their tier is explicitly separate from product reads.

## Tier 1: Lookup Primitives

### `POST /v2/lookup`

- Method/path: `POST /v2/lookup`
- Tier: lookup primitive.
- Purpose: batched forward name-to-record and reverse address-plus-coin-type
  resolution. `profile=feed` is the latency path; `profile=detail` returns
  full records.
- Request parameters: body `{inputs, profile, namespace?}`. Each input is
  `{id?, name}` or `{id?, address, coin_type?, relation?, page_size?, cursor?}`.
  Reverse inputs default to `coin_type=60` when omitted. Reverse `relation`
  accepts a comma-separated set of `owner`, `manager`, and `registrant`; `any`
  is the normalized all-three set. Reverse rows match when any listed relation
  matches. Batch limit is 1000 and is configurable with
  `BIGNAME_API_LOOKUP_BATCH_LIMIT`.
- Response shape: the common envelope. `data` is an array of result objects,
  not an object wrapper. The array contains one result per input in caller
  order. Each result is `{input, kind, status, unsupported_reason?,
  failure_reason?, normalization?, record?, records?, page?}`. `input` echoes
  the caller-supplied input, including `id` when supplied; omitted `id` is not
  synthesized. `kind` is `name` or `address`. Name results use `record` for the
  single record object. Reverse results use `records` for zero or more record
  rows with `is_primary` and `relations` in addition to the shared record
  fields. Reverse `input.relation` echoes the normalized relation set; `any`
  serializes as `owner,manager,registrant` and reordered sets use canonical
  dictionary order. `profile=feed` returns a documented core-field subset of
  the same record object; it does not introduce another DTO.
- Pagination behavior: top-level `page` is absent. Reverse inputs use the
  standard `page` object inside each result. Detail and feed use identical
  pagination semantics; feed only reduces returned fields. Reverse inputs
  default `page_size` to 50 and use the common max of 200. Relation filters
  that cannot be satisfied by one storage role (including exact `owner`, exact
  `registrant`, and partial relation sets such as `owner,manager`) may return
  an as-filled page with `has_more=true` when the API reaches its bounded
  post-filter scan cap; clients continue with the returned `next_cursor`.
- Status semantics: per-result `status` uses the common result vocabulary.
  Name misses are in-band `not_found`; invalid names are in-band
  `invalid_name`. Reverse misses return `status=ok` with an empty `records`
  array for the input. Lookup record-level reason values are mapped to product
  vocabulary before serialization; current values include `read_failed`,
  `exact_name_profile_not_supported`, `mixed_exact_name_corpus`, and
  `unsupported_reason_missing`.
- Replaces (v1): `POST /v1/identity:lookup`.

### `GET /v2/status`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/status`
- Tier: lookup primitive.
- Purpose: per-chain indexing readiness.
- Request parameters: none.
- Response shape: `data.status` plus `data.chains`, keyed by `chain_id`.
  Each chain entry carries `latest_block`, `indexed_block`, `safe_block`,
  `finalized_block`, `lag_blocks`, `lag_seconds`, and route-local ops
  `status`.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: route-local ops `status` is `ready`, `degraded`, or
  `stale`. This is the only non-result `status` enum in `v2`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/status`.

## Tier 2: Product Reads

### `GET /v2/names/{name}`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/names/{name}`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: name profile, using the flat record shape plus registration summary.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `source`. `source` accepts `indexed` or `verified`; omitting it is identical
  to `source=indexed`. This profile route does not accept `source=auto`.
- Response shape: `data` is one flat record object using dictionary fields.
  The registration summary is not nested; it is represented by
  `registration_id`, `token_id`, `owner`, `manager`, `registrant`,
  `registered_at`, `created_at`, `expires_at`, and `registration_status` on
  the same object when backed. `manager` is omitted when no forward-read source
  can derive it; it is not emitted as a permanent null placeholder. The profile
  portion uses `name`, `display_name`, `namespace`, `namehash`, `resolver`,
  `addresses`, `text_records`, `content_hash`,
  `primary_name`, `primary_address`, `chain_id`, `network`, `status`, and
  `unsupported_reason`/`failure_reason`/`unsupported_fields` when those fields
  are served. With `source=verified`, the resolver-record-backed fields
  `addresses`, `text_records`, `content_hash`, and `primary_address` are built
  from the same persisted-or-on-demand verified execution path used by
  `/v2/names/{name}/records`; indexed resolver-record values are not substituted
  into those fields. The registration and identity summary fields
  (`registration_id`, `token_id`, `owner`, `manager`, `registrant`, dates,
  `registration_status`, `name`, `display_name`, `namespace`, `namehash`,
  `resolver`, `primary_name`, `chain_id`, and `network`) remain indexed
  projection values because they are not resolver records. Persisted or
  snapshot-pinned verified profile responses include
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token`; the response supplied by route-local
  on-demand verified execution omits both. On a `200` profile,
  `status` is the flat-record result: `ok` for clean indexed reads; `failed`,
  `stale`, or `unsupported` may appear only when `source=verified` cannot serve
  the verified sections, with `failure_reason` or `unsupported_reason` carrying
  the product reason when available;
  `not_found` and `invalid_name` are unreachable in-record.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: valid names with no profile return `404 not_found`.
  Invalid path names return `400 invalid_input`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/names/{namespace}/{name}` and
  `GET /v1/profiles/names/{name}`.

### `GET /v2/names/{name}/records`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/names/{name}/records`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: resolver records.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `source=indexed|verified|auto`, `keys`, `include=inventory`.
- Response shape: `data` returns resolver record values using `namespace`,
  `resolver`, `addresses`, `text_records`, and `content_hash`. `keys` is a
  comma-separated
  record-key allowlist using the existing app key grammar: `addr:<coin_type>`,
  `text:<key>`, `avatar`, and `contenthash`. Requested-key outcomes are also
  returned in route-local `records`, keyed by the requested key; each value is
  `{status, value?, unsupported_reason?, failure_reason?}`. `source=verified`
  and verified fallback from `source=auto` use persisted verified outcomes when
  available and otherwise attempt on-demand verified execution behind `source=`.
  A supported verified value that cannot be served or executed for the selected
  snapshot is reported per key as `status=stale` with a `failure_reason`.
  Product records use product reason vocabulary: retained-selector misses use
  `value_not_retained`, and phase-unsupported record families use
  `record_family_not_supported`.
  `source=auto` blends per key: indexed answers are used where they satisfy the
  requested key, and only the remaining supported keys fall back to verified
  readback or on-demand execution.
  `include=inventory` adds route-local
  `inventory: {known_keys, unset_keys, unsupported_keys}`. Deep inventory
  internals stay on diagnostics.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: a missing name returns `404 not_found`. Missing, unset, or
  unsupported requested record values are reported with the common result
  `status` vocabulary inside the record answer rather than by changing the
  envelope.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/names/{namespace}/{name}/records` and record
  sections of `GET /v1/profiles/names/{name}`.

### `GET /v2/names/{name}/subnames`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/names/{name}/subnames`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: direct subnames.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `include=counts`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of dedicated subname rows in dictionary
  vocabulary: `name`, `display_name`, `namespace`, `namehash`, `labelhash`,
  `owner`, `registrant`, `registration_status`, `registered_at`,
  `created_at`, and `expires_at`. Resolver records are not included here;
  use `GET /v2/names/{name}/records` for `resolver`, `addresses`,
  `text_records`, and `content_hash`.
  `include=counts` adds `subname_count`, the row's direct subname count.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination by
  `display_name` ascending.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used to resolve the
  parent name and `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token`. The subname list itself
  reads the latest `children_current` projection; true as-of child enumeration
  is deferred to a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no direct subnames returns `200` with empty `data`.
  Missing parent names return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/names/{namespace}/{name}/children`.

### `GET /v2/names/{name}/history`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/names/{name}/history`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: name history.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `scope=name|registration|both`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of dedicated lean event rows:
  `{type, name, namespace, registration_id, block_number, timestamp,
  transaction_hash, log_index}`. `registration_id` is present only when the
  event row is registration-resource anchored. Rows never include before/after
  state, raw normalized-event payloads, or a `data` change object. Friendly
  `type` vocabulary: `registration`, `renewal`, `release`, `expiry`,
  `transfer`, `authority`, `resolver`, `record`, `primary_name`, `permission`.
  Raw upstream or pipeline event kinds are diagnostics-only and are not emitted
  by this product route.
- Pagination behavior: standard newest-first collection pagination by chain
  position. The cursor is bound to the resolved namespace, parent name, scope,
  and snapshot token. Product event-type filtering is applied after loading the
  storage page, so `page_size` is an upper bound on returned product rows; a
  page may contain fewer than `page_size` rows when non-product normalized
  events are interleaved.
- Scope behavior: `scope=name` reads name-surface events only,
  `scope=registration` reads registration-resource events associated with the
  requested name, and `scope=both` reads both sets. `scope` defaults to `both`.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used to resolve the
  parent name and `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token`. The history list itself
  reads latest normalized-event history; true as-of history enumeration is
  deferred to a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no matching history returns `200` with empty `data`.
  Missing names return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/history/names/{namespace}/{name}`.
  Registration-id anchored history from `GET /v1/history/resources/{resource_id}`
  moves to `GET /v2/events?registration_id=...`. `scope=registration` on this
  route is limited to registration lifecycles associated with the requested
  name.

### `GET /v2/permissions`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/permissions`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: flat permission rows by name, registration, or address, including
  registrations that are no longer a name's current one.
- Request parameters: at least one of `name`, `registration_id`, or `address`;
  filters are combinable. Query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `include=lineage`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of permission rows
  `{address, grant_scope, powers, registration_id, name}`. `include=lineage`
  adds route-local `lineage` per row:
  `{grant, revocation?, inheritance_path?, transfer_behavior?}`. Product lineage
  is a bounded summary; deep provenance stays on diagnostics authority/events
  routes. Lineage objects expose only allowlisted fields: `kind`,
  `registration_id`, `resolver: {chain_id, address}`, and `powers` when those
  fields apply. `kind` values are `event`, `permission`,
  `registration_authority`, `registration_rebound`, `ens_v1_authority`,
  `resolver_root_fallback`, and `registry_root_fallback`. Diagnostics-only
  storage keys such as event provenance, upstream/root resources,
  contract-instance ids, changed powers, and manifest versions are omitted.
  `grant_scope` is `{kind, detail}`. Detail is `{}` for `root`, `registry`,
  and `registration`;
  `{resolver: {chain_id, address}}` for `resolver` with numeric `chain_id`;
  `{chain_id, manager}` for `record_manager`; `{predecessor_registration_id}`
  for `migration_derived`; and `{transport}` for `transport_derived`.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used to resolve
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` and the `name` filter's registration anchor.
  Permission rows read the latest permissions projection; true as-of permission
  enumeration is deferred to a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no matching permission rows returns `200` with empty
  `data`, including when a `name` filter has no registration anchor in the
  selected snapshot. Unsupported filter combinations return `422 unsupported`.
  After snapshot selection, an absent or older projection-owned permission
  publication version returns `409 stale` before permission rows are decoded.
  A publication revision change while rows and summaries are read also returns
  `409 stale`. The version and revision are schema/publication compatibility and
  request-coherence guards, not freshness watermarks. When `name` or
  `registration_id` binds the read to a registration, the projection-owned
  per-registration permission summary classifies the result: full support adds
  no completeness metadata, missing or partial support returns
  `meta.completeness=partial` with
  `unsupported_reason=permission_support_unknown`, and an ENSv1 wrapper returns
  `meta.completeness=unsupported` with
  `unsupported_reason=wrapper_holder_permissions_not_supported`. An
  address-only read is always at least `partial` with the wrapper reason because
  zero-row wrapper registrations are absent from the permission-row fan-out; a
  missing or partial summary for a returned registration changes the reason to
  `permission_support_unknown`. Projected rows are not suppressed by these
  classifications.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/resources/{resource_id}/permissions`,
  `GET /v1/roles`, `GET /v1/names/{namespace}/{name}/roles`, and
  `GET /v1/resources/lookup`.

### `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/names`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/names`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: names related to an address.
- Request parameters: path `address`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `relation`, `q`, `sort=name|expires_at|registered_at`, `order=asc|desc`,
  `dedupe=name|registration`, `include=role_summary`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
  `q` applies prefix matching to the dictionary `name` field case-insensitively:
  the prefix is lowercased to match the normalized name, and full Unicode
  normalization of partial prefixes is a follow-up. This route does not accept
  `match`. `relation` accepts a comma-separated set of v2 vocabulary values
  `owner`, `manager`, and `registrant`; `any` normalizes to all three values.
  Rows match when any listed relation matches. The storage relations map as
  token-holder -> `owner`, effective-controller -> `manager`, and
  registrant -> `registrant`. `dedupe=name` groups by name surface and is the
  default; `dedupe=registration` groups by registration resource.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of record-shaped rows with `name`,
  `display_name`, `namespace`, `namehash`, `owner`, `registrant`,
  `registration_status`, `registered_at`, `created_at`, and `expires_at`.
  Address-name rows add `is_primary` and `relations`, where `relations` is the
  subset of `owner`, `manager`, and `registrant` that matched. `is_primary` is
  evaluated against that row namespace's coin-type-60 primary-name claim, not a
  route-wide namespace shortcut. Resolver records are not included; use
  `GET /v2/names/{name}/records` for resolver data.
  `include=role_summary` adds
  `role_summary: [{address, grants: [{grant_scope, powers}]}]` grouped by the
  permission subject address and `record_count` when record inventory exists
  for the row. `record_count` counts the known record selectors for the name's
  current registration, including unsupported-family selectors and excluding
  explicit gaps. `grant_scope` uses the same shape documented for
  `GET /v2/permissions`.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination. Cursors are bound to
  address, optional namespace filter, normalized relation set, `q`, dedupe
  mode, sort, order, and the snapshot token emitted as `meta.as_of_token`.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used only to resolve
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` (default namespace `ens` when `namespace` is
  omitted). The address-name collection itself reads the latest
  `address_names_current` projection; true as-of address-name enumeration is
  deferred to a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no related names returns `200` with empty `data`.
  Malformed addresses return `400 invalid_input`. `include=role_summary`
  conditionally returns `409 stale` when the compatible projection-owned
  permission publication version is absent or old; the same address-name read
  without that expansion remains available. The expansion also returns `409
  stale` when the permission publication revision changes while it is assembled.
  The expansion batch-loads projection-owned permission summaries for every
  registration on the served page. If all are full, no completeness metadata is
  added. A missing or partial summary returns `meta.completeness=partial`,
  `meta.unsupported_fields=["role_summary"]`, and
  `unsupported_reason=permission_support_unknown`. An ENSv1 wrapper summary
  uses the same `partial` response classification and unsupported field with
  `unsupported_reason=wrapper_holder_permissions_not_supported`. Projected
  grants remain in `role_summary`, but the expansion is non-authoritative;
  therefore an empty wrapper summary is not a proven empty permission set.
  Missing summary metadata takes precedence when a page contains both cases.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/addresses/{address}/names` and address-relation
  uses of `GET /v1/names`.

### `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/primary-name`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/primary-name`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: primary name for an address.
- Request parameters: path `address`; query `coin_type` default `60`,
  `namespace` default `ens`, and `source`. This is a current-state read and
  does not accept `at` or `finality`.
- Response shape: `data` is
  `{address, coin_type, namespace, answers, verification?}` with `coin_type`
  serialized as a JSON number. `answers` is an
  array of `{source, status, name?, raw_claim_name?, unsupported_reason?,
  failure_reason?}` entries. When `source` is omitted, the route returns one
  entry for each answer source in stable `indexed`, then `verified` order;
  unsupported sources are represented by an entry with `status=unsupported`,
  not omitted.
  Supplying `source=indexed` or `source=verified` narrows the `answers` array
  to that source for single-source callers. `verification` is
  `{status, name?, unsupported_reason?, failure_reason?}` and appears whenever
  a persisted or on-demand verified outcome exists. As an explicit exception,
  it also appears when the request includes the `verified` source and the
  projected or route-local on-demand claim fails the pre-forward normalization
  gate; this synthetic gate result does not represent a forward resolver call.
  An indexed-only response never includes `verification`. The `verified` answer
  entry is the source-specific payload; `verification` is the typed comparison
  summary and must not contradict that entry. Claimed-vs-verified remains one
  call without `declared_state`/`verified_state`. When a served head is
  available, `meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token` record the served positions
  for staleness attribution and shadow-diff correlation. When the ENS/60
  route-local on-demand fallback supplies the answer instead of persisted
  snapshot state, the response omits `meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token`.
  Basenames responses that serve a persisted verified answer include both the
  Base authority position and the Ethereum resolution-auxiliary position;
  indexed-only responses and missing persisted verified outcomes remain
  Base-scoped.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Snapshot behavior: current-state read over chain-derived primary-name state.
  The route does not accept `at` or `finality`. Successful responses carry
  `meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token` for indexed and persisted state served at
  the API's current chain head. When the tuple is missing and the route falls
  through to the live on-demand ENS RPC fallback, both fields are omitted because
  that fallback is not yet pinned to the indexed head.
- Status semantics: answer entries use in-band `status`. Valid tuples with no
  indexed claim return an `indexed` entry with `status=not_found`. Unsupported,
  not-found, failed, and mismatched verified outcomes return `200` with the
  corresponding `verified` entry status. When the requested output includes the
  verified source, a successful projected or on-demand claim whose raw spelling
  differs from its normalized form produces a verified answer and
  `verification` with `status=not_found` and
  `failure_reason=claim_not_normalized`. An unnormalizable on-demand claim
  produces an indexed answer with `status=invalid_name` and `raw_claim_name`
  when the indexed source is included, and a verified answer plus `verification`
  with `status=not_found` and `failure_reason=claim_name_not_normalizable` when
  the verified source is included. Malformed addresses return `400
  invalid_input`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/primary-names/{address}`.

### `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/history`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/history`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: address activity history.
- Request parameters: path `address`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`,
  `relation`, `scope=name|registration|both`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
  `namespace` defaults to `ens` when omitted. `relation` accepts a
  comma-separated set of `owner`, `manager`, and `registrant`; `any`
  normalizes to all three values. Rows match when any listed relation matches.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of compact event rows using the shared
  friendly `type` vocabulary.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used to resolve
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` (default namespace `ens` when `namespace` is
  omitted). The address-history collection currently reads latest
  normalized-event rows; true as-of/finality row-bounding is deferred to a
  storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no matching activity returns `200` with empty `data`.
  Malformed addresses return `400 invalid_input`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/history/addresses/{address}`.

### `GET /v2/search`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/search`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: name search and suggestions. No availability or pricing semantics.
- Request parameters: query `q`, `match=prefix|contains` default `prefix`,
  `namespace`, `at`, `finality`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of record-shaped name search results in
  dictionary vocabulary.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used only to resolve
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` (the snapshot scope spans all public
  namespaces when `namespace` is omitted, and the single namespace when
  provided). The search collection itself reads the latest `name_current`
  projection; true as-of search enumeration is deferred to a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no matches returns `200` with empty `data`. `q` is
  required; a missing or empty `q` returns `400 invalid_input`.
  Namespace-omitted search returns `409 conflict` when the selector cannot form
  one canonical snapshot across the public namespaces' deployment profiles;
  specify `namespace` to search a single namespace profile.
- Replaces (v1): search, suggestion, and exact-name-filter uses of
  `GET /v1/names`; exact name profiles move to `GET /v2/names/{name}`.

### `GET /v2/events`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/events`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: compact event search across name, address, registration, type, and
  block filters.
- Request parameters: query `namespace`, `name`, `address`,
  `registration_id`, `type`, `from_block`, `to_block`, `at`, `finality`,
  `cursor`, and `page_size`. When `name` is present and `namespace` is omitted,
  namespace is inferred from the name; `namespace` defaults to `ens` only when
  there is no name filter.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of compact event rows with friendly
  `type` vocabulary. Raw upstream event kinds are diagnostics-only.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used to resolve
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` using the same name-inference and default
  namespace rules as request parameters. The event collection currently reads
  latest normalized-event rows; true as-of/finality row-bounding is deferred to
  a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no matching events returns `200` with empty `data`.
  Malformed filters return `400 invalid_input`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/events` compact event search.

### `GET /v2/resolvers/{chain_id}/{address}`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/resolvers/{chain_id}/{address}`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: resolver overview for numeric `chain_id` and resolver `address`.
- Request parameters: path `chain_id`, `address`; query `include` for
  route-documented sections, `at`, `finality`, `cursor`, `page_size`.
- Response shape: `data` is a resolver overview in product vocabulary. The
  route includes route-local `bound_names: {data, page}`, a nested collection
  of record-shaped name rows that replaces resolver-based name filtering.
  `include=aliases` exposes binding rows as `{namespace, name, display_name,
  namehash}` and resolver alias rows as `{namespace, from_name, to_name,
  from_display_name?, to_display_name?, state, resolver: {chain_id, address},
  to_registration_id?}`. `to_name` is `null` when the latest alias state is
  `removed` or `unknown`. `include=events` exposes `{count, by_type}` where
  `by_type` aggregates raw resolver event kinds that map to the same friendly
  `type` vocabulary as `GET /v2/events`; raw kinds without a product event type
  remain included in `count` but are excluded from `by_type`.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination applies to the
  nested `bound_names.page` object. The top-level response has no `page`.
- Status semantics: an otherwise valid resolver with no overview row returns
  `404 not_found`. A resolver overview with no bound names returns `200` with
  an empty bound-names section. Malformed `chain_id` or `address` returns
  `400 invalid_input`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/resolvers/{chain_id}/{resolver_address}/overview`
  and the `GET /v1/names?resolver=...` filter.

### `GET /v2/namespaces/{namespace}`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/namespaces/{namespace}`
- Tier: product read.
- Purpose: namespace metadata and supported-capability summary in product
  vocabulary.
- Request parameters: path `namespace`.
- Response shape: `data` is `{namespace, capabilities, networks}`.
  `capabilities` is a product-facing object keyed by capability name; each
  value is `{completeness, unsupported_reason?}` using the common
  completeness vocabulary. `networks` is an array of `{network, chain_id?}`
  entries when the namespace has public chain mappings. Control-plane metadata
  omits `meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token`.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: unsupported public namespaces return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/namespaces/{namespace}`. Operational namespace
  internals move to the diagnostics namespace route documented below.

## Tier 3: Diagnostics

Diagnostics are the only routes that may carry pipeline vocabulary. Product
route vocabulary restrictions do not apply to the diagnostic payloads below.

Diagnostic snapshot rules:

- `/v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/coverage`,
  `/v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/binding`,
  `/v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/authority`,
  `/v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/records`,
  `/v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/execution`, and `/v2/diagnostics/events`
  accept `at` and `finality` and carry `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` because
  they explain the same selected snapshot as product reads.
- Diagnostics execution selection uses the exact name, `keys`, and selected
  snapshot. Omitting `at` selects the latest persisted execution artifact.
  RFC 3339 `at` selects the newest persisted artifact whose requested chain
  positions are at or before the selected positions. If multiple artifacts
  match, the deterministic tie-break is newest `finished_at`, then greatest
  `execution_trace_id`.
- `/v2/diagnostics/namespaces/{namespace}/manifests` omits `meta.as_of` and
  `meta.as_of_token`; it is control-plane metadata.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/coverage`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/coverage`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: full coverage taxonomy.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`.
- Response shape: `data` includes `exhaustiveness`, `enumeration_basis`,
  `source_classes_considered`, and `unsupported_reason` detail.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: missing names return `404 not_found`; unsupported coverage
  classes return diagnostic detail rather than product simplification.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/coverage/{namespace}/{name}`.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/binding`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/binding`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: surface-binding explain.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`.
- Response shape: `data` includes binding ids, binding kind, and anchors.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: missing names return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/explain/names/{namespace}/{name}/surface-binding`.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/authority`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/authority`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: authority/control explain.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`.
- Response shape: `data` includes token lineage, control vectors, and
  permission lineage.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: missing names return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/explain/names/{namespace}/{name}/authority-control`.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/records`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/records`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: record inventory and cache internals.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`, and
  optional `keys`. `keys` uses the same record-key grammar as
  `/v2/names/{name}/records`: `addr:<coin_type>`, `text:<key>`, `avatar`, and
  `contenthash`.
- Response shape: `data` is
  `{record_inventory, record_cache, value_sources, comparison,
  comparison_explicit_gaps?}`.
  `record_inventory` is
  `{record_version_boundary, enumeration_basis, selectors, explicit_gaps,
  unsupported_families, last_change}` using the existing diagnostic selector
  row fields `record_key`, `record_family`, `selector_key`, and `cacheable`.
  `record_cache` is `{record_version_boundary, entries}` where each entry is
  `{record_key, record_family, selector_key, status, value?,
  unsupported_reason?, failure_reason?}`. `value_sources` summarizes the
  indexed or verified origin per key. `comparison` is keyed by `record_key` and
  carries side-by-side `{indexed, verified}` record answers for the former
  `mode=both` workflow. Without `keys`, `comparison` defaults to the first 16
  inventory-derived supported record keys in deterministic order. The indexed
  `record_inventory` and `record_cache` sections remain complete. When more
  than 16 default comparison keys are available, `comparison_explicit_gaps`
  lists each uncompared selector as
  `{record_key, record_family, selector_key, gap_reason}` with
  `gap_reason=diagnostics_comparison_default_limit_exceeded`. With `keys`, the
  comparison is scoped exactly to the requested keys. On-demand verified
  comparison execution is chunked to at most 4 in-flight selector RPCs per
  diagnostics request burst. Identity objects in these diagnostics use dictionary
  spellings (`namespace`, `name`, `display_name`, `registration_id`), while
  pipeline-only identifiers such as `normalized_event_id` keep their pipeline
  names per the tier-3 rule.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: missing names return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): record inventory/cache diagnostics formerly embedded in
  `GET /v1/profiles/names/{name}` and
  `GET /v1/names/{namespace}/{name}/records`, including the former
  `mode=both` comparison.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/execution`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/names/{name}/execution`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: persisted verified-execution explain.
- Request parameters: path `name`; query `namespace`, `at`, `finality`, and
  required `keys`.
  `keys` uses the same record-key grammar as `/v2/names/{name}/records`. The
  route is verified-only; callers select the persisted artifact by exact name,
  requested keys, and selected snapshot. The route rejects duplicate or
  malformed keys with `400 invalid_input`.
- Response shape: `data` includes trace id, steps, digests, and CCIP
  participation. Identity objects in the payload use dictionary spellings
  (`namespace`, `name`, `display_name`, `registration_id`), while pipeline-only
  identifiers keep their pipeline names per the tier-3 rule.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: missing persisted execution artifacts return
  `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/explain/resolutions/{namespace}/{name}/execution`.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/namespaces/{namespace}/manifests`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/namespaces/{namespace}/manifests`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: active manifest versions, source families, deployment epochs, and
  capability flags.
- Request parameters: path `namespace`.
- Response shape: `data` is the active manifest summary in diagnostics
  vocabulary.
- Pagination behavior: none.
- Status semantics: unsupported public namespaces return `404 not_found`.
- Replaces (v1): `GET /v1/manifests/{namespace}`.

### `GET /v2/diagnostics/events`

- Method/path: `GET /v2/diagnostics/events`
- Tier: diagnostics.
- Purpose: raw normalized-event rows: upstream event kinds, event identity, and
  full provenance.
- Request parameters: query `namespace`, `name`, `address`,
  `registration_id`, `type`, `from_block`, `to_block`, `at`, `finality`,
  `cursor`, and `page_size`. When `name` is present and `namespace` is omitted,
  namespace is inferred from the name; `namespace` defaults to `ens` only when
  there is no name filter.
- Response shape: `data` is an array of raw normalized-event rows in
  diagnostics vocabulary:
  `{normalized_event_id, event_identity, namespace, name?, registration_id?,
  event_kind, source_family, manifest_version?, source_manifest_id?,
  chain_position, transaction_hash, log_index, raw_fact_ref, derivation_kind,
  canonicality_state, before_state?, after_state?, provenance, coverage}`.
- Pagination behavior: standard collection pagination.
- Snapshot behavior: `at` and `finality` are accepted and used to resolve
  `meta.as_of`/`meta.as_of_token` using the same name-inference and default
  namespace rules as request parameters. The diagnostics event collection
  currently reads latest normalized-event rows; true as-of/finality row-bounding
  is deferred to a storage follow-up.
- Status semantics: no matching rows returns `200` with empty `data`.
- Replaces (v1): `view=full` on `GET /v1/history/names/{namespace}/{name}`,
  `GET /v1/history/resources/{resource_id}`, and
  `GET /v1/history/addresses/{address}`.
