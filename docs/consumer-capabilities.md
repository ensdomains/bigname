# Consumer Capability Baseline

Status: Phase 0 baseline

This document is the checked-in replacement contract for first-party consumers until the apps monorepo is imported and mapped call-site by call-site.

## 1. Capability Groups

| Capability | Example consumer surface | Native `v1` responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| exact name profile | profile pages, record editing, registration views | `Name.registration` + `Resolution` |
| names owned / controlled by address | dashboards and search flows | `Address.names` |
| names owned / controlled by address with role summary | dashboard lists | `Address.names` with `include=role_summary` |
| declared child subnames and counts | subname pages and creation flows | `Name.children` |
| record inventory for editing | profile and records screens | `Resolution.record_inventory` + `Resolution.record_cache` |
| verified record reads | profile, send, and address-resolution flows | `Resolution.verified_queries` |
| name history | profile history pages | `History(scope=both)` |
| address history across names | address activity views | `Address.history` |
| role holders for a resource | roles pages | `Permissions.by_resource` |
| role change history | roles history pages | `History(filter=permissions)` |
| resolver-centric overview | resolver pages | `Resolver` |
| claimed vs verified primary name | dashboard and profile | `PrimaryName.claimed_primary_name` + `PrimaryName.verified_primary_name` |

## 2. Current Status

- this is the working baseline for Phase 0
- `Address.names` with `include=role_summary` is an additive expansion of the same address-to-surface collection; it is not a separate route or replacement surface
- `Address.history` is the declared-state address activity read over address-derived surface and resource anchors; it reuses the shared history contract rather than introducing a separate truth system
- `Resolution` is one mixed route: `record_inventory` defines the known record-selector space, `record_cache` is the declared last-known-value view over that same selector space, and `verified_queries` is the explicit request-bound execution answer set
- `GET /v1/resolve/{name}` is a convenience entry to the same `Resolution` capability, not a separate consumer capability: exact `base.eth` infers `namespace=ens`, names matching `*.base.eth` infer `namespace=basenames`, other supported ENS names infer `namespace=ens`, and the response still exposes canonical namespaced identity through fields such as `data.namespace` and `data.logical_name_id`
- namespace-inferred resolution does not change verified-support meaning: inferred Basenames requests use Basenames-local selector and topology support, return selector-local `unsupported` when that support is unavailable, and do not fall back to ENS
- ENSv2 exact-name profile support is promoted only for the selected `sepolia-dev` deployment profile when `ens_v2_registrar_l1` declares `exact_name_profile = "supported"`; that support class covers declared exact-name profile reads from the admitted `ETHRegistry` and `ETHRegistrar` sources, and it does not graduate resolver-profile support, verified resolution, primary-name support, history coverage, other deployment profiles, or consumer replacement for unrelated capability groups (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/interfaces/IETHRegistrar.sol:L32 @ ens_v2@554c309).
- ENSv1 and Basenames `Resolution.record_inventory`, `Resolution.record_cache`, and resolver-centric overview are not consumer-replacement complete merely because resolver discovery admits registry-observed resolver addresses. A current resolver target in registry state is insufficient by itself; resolver-local facts must come from a direct manifest-admitted or discovery-admitted resolver contract whose supported profile is admitted for the relevant record family (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/registry/ENS.sol:L12 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L132 @ basenames@1809bbc).
- ENSv1 dynamic resolver-profile admission is PublicResolver-compatible only in this phase. A discovered resolver that is watched but has `pending` or `unsupported` profile state remains topology-only and does not satisfy `Resolution.record_inventory`, `Resolution.record_cache`, or resolver-centric overview cutover evidence. This does not widen Basenames resolver-profile support (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L20 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol:L31 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/contracts/resolvers/ResolverBase.sol:L17 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L132 @ basenames@1809bbc).
- `PrimaryName` is one mixed route: `claimed_primary_name` is the declared claim candidate and `verified_primary_name` is the execution-derived verification result
- both mixed routes reuse the same `ResultStatus` vocabulary: `success`, `not_found`, `mismatch`, `unsupported`, `invalid_name`, `execution_failed`
- wrapper/resolver/Basenames source-family backfill conformance proves only that completed source-family job lifecycle state for the admitted ENSv1 NameWrapper, ENSv1 PublicResolver, and Basenames source families can coexist with replayed existing shipped consumer-capability responses. It does not prove that synthetic jobs admitted route data, add a capability group, graduate unsupported coverage, expand the selected ENSv2 exact-name support promotion to other profiles, claim wrapper/migration history support, change manifest capabilities, add public API routes, or change consumer-replacement meaning (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/NameWrapper.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/ens_v1/deployments/mainnet/PublicResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v1@91c966f) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc).
- when the apps monorepo is imported, add app-by-app call-site mappings rather than replacing this table
- any capability required by a first-party consumer that is not covered here must be added here before code claims parity

## 3. Exit Condition For Consumer Cutover

Before first-party cutover:

- each capability must map to one or more concrete app call sites
- each capability must have contract tests
- each capability must have rollout and rollback criteria

## 4. Local Cutover Evidence Model

This model records local bigname evidence only. It is necessary for cutover planning, but it is not an external app parity claim and does not prove first-party app call-site replacement until the imported app call sites are mapped separately.
