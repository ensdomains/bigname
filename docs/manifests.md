# Source Manifests

Status: Phase 0 baseline

This document freezes how `bigname` represents source manifests, capability flags, and discovery admission.

## 1. Purpose

Manifests make watched contracts, capability support, and rollout state explicit. They are part of the truth model, not deploy-time configuration only.

## 2. File Format And Location

Manifests live in the repository as TOML:

```text
manifests/<namespace>/<source_family>/<version>.toml
```

Alternate deployment profiles use the same schema under a profile-specific repository root. The first ENSv2 alternate profile is `sepolia-dev`:

```text
manifests-sepolia-dev/<namespace>/<source_family>/v1.toml
```

One runtime selects exactly one manifest root at startup, such as `manifests/` for the shipped mainnet profile or `manifests-sepolia-dev/` for the ENSv2 Sepolia dev profile. Profile selection is not a manifest schema change, and a selected runtime must not load both roots into one canonical corpus, watch plan, discovery graph, or projection set.

Reasons for TOML:

- deterministic diffs
- easy hand-editing during protocol bootstrap
- straightforward Rust parsing

## 3. Required Fields

Each manifest contains:

- `manifest_version`
- `namespace`
- `source_family`
- `chain`
- `deployment_epoch`
- `rollout_status`
- `normalizer_version`
- `capability_flags`
- `roots`
- `contracts`
- `discovery_rules`

### `rollout_status`

- `draft`
- `shadow`
- `active`
- `deprecated`

### `capability_flags`

Capabilities are named and versioned. Each flag records:

- capability name
- status: `unsupported`, `shadow`, `supported`
- optional notes

### `chain`

- `chain` names the authority chain for that manifest within the selected deployment profile
- the shipped baseline uses mainnet chain IDs such as `ethereum-mainnet` and `base-mainnet`
- later Sepolia and `sepolia-dev` support is additive as a separate manifest root and chain-ID set, not a concurrent extension of the same runtime
- one runtime loads manifests from exactly one deployment profile at a time; it must not combine mainnet and Sepolia / `sepolia-dev` manifests in one canonical corpus, watch plan, discovery graph, or projection set

## 4. Example Shape

```toml
manifest_version = 1
namespace = "ens"
source_family = "ens_v2_registry_l1"
chain = "ethereum-mainnet"
deployment_epoch = "ens_v2"
rollout_status = "active"
normalizer_version = "uts46-v1"

[[roots]]
name = "RootRegistry"
address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
code_hash = "sha256:..."
abi_ref = "abis/ens_v2_root_registry.json"

[[contracts]]
role = "registry"
address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
proxy_kind = "none"
# Omit `implementation` when `proxy_kind = "none"`.

[[discovery_rules]]
edge_kind = "subregistry"
from_role = "registry"
admission = "reachable_from_root"

[capability_flags]
declared_children = "supported"
```

Capability ownership is source-family specific. For ENS verified resolution on Ethereum Mainnet, the authoritative execution manifest is `ens_execution`, not `ens_v1_registry_l1`. Its canonical contract entry is the ENS Universal Resolver.

Relevant manifest fields for that execution family:

```toml
source_family = "ens_execution"
chain = "ethereum-mainnet"

[[contracts]]
role = "universal_resolver"
address = "0xeEeEEEeE14D718C2B47D9923Deab1335E144EeEe"

[capability_flags]
verified_resolution = "shadow"
```

That freeze attaches `verified_resolution` ownership to `ens_execution`. It allows shadow execution traces and cache ownership without implying that public verified-resolution reads are already shipped.

The shipped Phase 7 ENS primary-name slices do not add a second execution capability flag here. `ens_execution` remains the execution owner for verified-primary readback, but the current `verified_primary_name` route behavior is still bootstrap-scoped and does not require a dedicated `verified_primary_name` manifest flag. The existing `verified_resolution = "shadow"` flag admits the shared shadow execution substrate only; it does not silently widen into a second manifest capability. If a later milestone needs dedicated manifest gating for verified primary-name reads, that flag would be an additive doc-first change.

ENS reverse-claim intake follows the same source-family discipline. For Ethereum Mainnet, later declared primary-claim intake is anchored to `ens_v1_reverse_l1`, not `ens_v1_registry_l1` or `ens_v1_resolver_l1`. Its canonical contract entry is the Ethereum `addr.reverse` Reverse Registrar.

Relevant manifest fields for that reverse family:

```toml
source_family = "ens_v1_reverse_l1"
chain = "ethereum-mainnet"

[[contracts]]
role = "reverse_registrar"
address = "0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb"
```

That freeze fixes the authoritative reverse entrypoint, source-family owner, and reverse-only intake precedence for later ENS primary-claim support. It does not define a new capability flag, does not add manifest schema, does not authorize fallback to registry-, resolver-, or other claim-setting surfaces, and does not by itself ship graduated public primary-name reads.

Within the claimed-vs-verified primary-name contract, that reverse family owns only the declared claim intake. The truth split stays explicit: `ens_v1_reverse_l1` admits the authoritative reverse claim source, while any verified primary-name result remains execution-derived through the execution owner already frozen above. The current reverse manifest may therefore be `rollout_status = "active"` with no dedicated primary-name capability flag at all. That combination means the reverse claim surface is admitted for declared intake only; it does not imply shipped public primary-name read support, verified-primary support, richer tuple-present route payloads, or graduated public coverage. In Phase 7 it also does not authorize combining the admitted reverse tuple with resolver-backed or execution-derived name identity to fill richer ENS `claimed_primary_name` payloads.

That absence is intentional for the shipped Phase 7 route: `ens_v1_reverse_l1` does not need a dedicated `claimed_primary_name`, `primary_name_claim`, or similar capability flag to admit the declared reverse-claim tuple. Later primary-name capability flagging, if ever needed, would be additive and would have to preserve the existing truth split between reverse-owned declared intake and execution-derived verification.

ENSv2 Phase 5 source-family ownership for the `sepolia-dev` alternate profile is frozen to four admitted families under `manifests-sepolia-dev/ens/...`:

- `ens_v2_root_l1` owns the `RootRegistry` manifest root at `0x3a3e15a5d27ff6f05c844313312f2e72096d3ed3` and the root-registry event surface needed to seed registry discovery and parent graph state; the upstream registry is a tokenized, resource-scoped permissioned registry with separate resource and token version counters (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/RootRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L22 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/PermissionedRegistry.sol:L28 @ ens_v2@554c309).
- `ens_v2_registry_l1` owns the `ETHRegistry` manifest root at `0x796fff2e907449be8d5921bcc215b1b76d89d080` plus discovered `UserRegistry` proxy instances admitted through registry discovery edges; the checked-in `UserRegistryImpl` deployment at `0xea93aff7375e8176053ab6ab36b57cab53cbf702` is implementation metadata for proxy-backed user registries, not a separate public source-family owner (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/UserRegistryImpl.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/UserRegistry.sol:L15 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/UserRegistry.sol:L59 @ ens_v2@554c309).
- `ens_v2_registrar_l1` owns the `.eth` registrar deployment `ETHRegistrar` at `0x68586418353b771cf2425ed14a07512aa880c532`; registrar events and commit/renew facts stay in this family, while the actual registered-name resource identity is linked back to the permissioned registry resource emitted by the registry (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/ETHRegistrar.sol:L49 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registrar/ETHRegistrar.sol:L173 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309).
- `ens_v2_resolver_l1` owns `PermissionedResolver` resolver state, alias events, record-version events, and resolver-scoped EAC permission facts; `PermissionedResolverImpl` at `0xe566a1fbaf30ff7c39828fe99f955fc55544cb9c` is the initial implementation artifact for discovered resolver instances, while resolver instances themselves enter the source graph through manifest or discovery admission (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/PermissionedResolverImpl.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L38 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L70 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L121 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/PermissionedResolver.sol:L221 @ ens_v2@554c309).

The ENSv2 `sepolia-dev` exact-name profile remains shadow-only in this Phase 5 manifest contract. `ens_v2_registrar_l1` may carry `exact_name_profile = { status = "shadow", ... }` to admit registrar lifecycle facts and registry-linked resource identity for projection/backfill work, but no `sepolia-dev` family may treat that flag, `rollout_status = "active"`, or the presence of `ETHRegistry` / `ETHRegistrar` contracts as `exact_name_profile=supported`. Public exact-name profile reads must surface unsupported coverage with `unsupported_reason="ensv2 sepolia-dev exact-name profile is shadow-only"` until a later manifest version and doc-first contract update promote the capability to `supported` (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L69 @ ens_v2@554c309).

The Phase 5 split maps upstream `TokenResource(tokenId, resource)` logs to normalized `TokenResourceLinked`, upstream `TokenRegenerated(oldTokenId, newTokenId)` logs to normalized `TokenRegenerated`, upstream `SubregistryUpdated` logs to normalized `SubregistryChanged`, upstream `ParentUpdated` logs to normalized `ParentChanged`, upstream `AliasChanged` logs to normalized `AliasChanged`, and upstream `EACRolesChanged` logs to resource- or resolver-scoped permission events. Those mappings are adapter semantics, not manifest schema fields (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IPermissionedRegistry.sol:L34 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L69 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L49 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/registry/interfaces/IRegistryEvents.sol:L75 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/resolver/interfaces/IPermissionedResolver.sol:L14 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/src/access-control/interfaces/IEnhancedAccessControl.sol:L19 @ ens_v2@554c309).

This freeze does not create current source-family owners for the additional `sepolia-dev` deployment artifacts such as the ENSv2 universal resolver, reverse registries, DNS resolvers, wrapper implementation, migration controllers, factory contracts, oracle contracts, batch registrars, or payment mocks. Later admission of those surfaces would be additive and doc-first (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/UniversalResolverV2.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ReverseRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/DNSAliasResolver.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/WrapperRegistryImpl.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/LockedMigrationController.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/HCAFactory.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/StandardRentPriceOracle.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/BatchRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/MockUSDC.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/MockDAI.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309).

Basenames source-family ownership on the shipped mainnet profile is frozen across six admitted families (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc):

- `basenames_base_registry` owns registry-controlled declared authority through contract role `registry` at `0xb94704422c2a1e396835a571837aa5ae53285a95` on Base Mainnet because the upstream Registry stores per-node owner / resolver / ttl state and authorizes owner-controlled subnode and resolver updates there (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L10 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L100 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L113 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/Registry.sol:L132 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `basenames_base_registrar` owns tokenized registrar authority through contract role `registrar` at `0x03c4738ee98ae44591e1a4a4f3cab6641d95dd9a` on Base Mainnet because the upstream BaseRegistrar owns `base.eth`, mints `*.base.eth` subdomains, and can reclaim Base registry ownership after token transfers (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/BaseRegistrar.sol:L15 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/BaseRegistrar.sol:L17 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/BaseRegistrar.sol:L237 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/BaseRegistrar.sol:L327 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/BaseRegistrar.sol:L423 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `basenames_base_resolver` owns Base-native declared resolver state through contract role `resolver` at `0xC6d566A56A1aFf6508b41f6c90ff131615583BCD` on Base Mainnet because the upstream `L2Resolver` is the default Base resolver and authorizes the registrar controller, reverse registrar, and name owners / delegates to modify resolver records (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L49 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L52 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/L2Resolver.sol:L193 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `basenames_base_primary` owns declared primary-claim intake through contract role `reverse_registrar` at `0x79ea96012eea67a83431f1701b3dff7e37f9e282` on Base Mainnet because the upstream ReverseRegistrar establishes reverse records and writes the claimed `name()` value there (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L150 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L193 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `basenames_l1_compat` owns L1 compatibility transport through contract role `l1_resolver` at `0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31` on Ethereum Mainnet because upstream assigns cross-chain resolution for the `base.eth` domain to the Ethereum Mainnet `L1Resolver` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L69 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc)
- `basenames_execution` owns verified-resolution entrypoint selection through contract role `l1_resolver` at `0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31` on Ethereum Mainnet with current `verified_resolution = "shadow"` because the same upstream `L1Resolver` is the execution entrypoint that initiates `OffchainLookup` and completes the verified callback through `resolveWithProof` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L154 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L173 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L191 @ basenames@1809bbc)

That freeze maps declared authority to the Base registry / registrar / resolver families, declared primary to `basenames_base_primary`, compatibility transport to `basenames_l1_compat`, and execution entrypoint selection to `basenames_execution` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L69 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc).

The current `basenames_execution` capability remains `shadow` until the public mixed and execution-explain routes both serve one exact-surface transport-assisted direct-path class where `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` equals the route surface, `wildcard.source=null` with `matched_labels=[]`, `alias.final_target=null` with `hops=[]`, `subregistry_path=[]`, `transport.source_chain_id="base-mainnet"`, `transport.target_chain_id="ethereum-mainnet"`, and `transport.contract_address="0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31"`. A later manifest version may promote only that `verified_resolution` capability from `shadow` to `supported` for `basenames_execution`; it does not move transport ownership away from `basenames_l1_compat` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L28 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L29 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L34 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L69 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L70 @ basenames@1809bbc).

The same Ethereum Mainnet L1 Resolver address may therefore be declared in both `basenames_l1_compat` and `basenames_execution`. That duplication is intentional: transport ownership remains with `basenames_l1_compat`, while execution entrypoint ownership and the shadow-to-supported verified-resolution rollout remain with `basenames_execution` (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc).

The first Basenames `verified_primary_name` support class does not add a second execution capability flag either. `basenames_execution` remains the execution owner for exact-tuple persisted `verified_primary_name` readback on `GET /v1/primary-names/{address}` under stable execution identity `request_type=verified_primary_name` and request-key identity `{namespace}:{normalized_address}:{coin_type}`. The matching `primary_names_current(address, coin_type, namespace)` row remains the only claim-side lookup / invalidation anchor, and the public `verified_primary_name.provenance` surface stays limited to `{execution_trace_id, manifest_versions}`; `verified_primary_name.provenance.execution_trace_id` must equal top-level `provenance.execution_trace_id`, and `manifest_versions` must narrow that same persisted verification trace. The existing `verified_resolution = "shadow"` flag admits the shared shadow execution substrate only; it does not silently widen route-level primary-name coverage or create a second manifest capability, because upstream keeps reverse-name writes on the Base ReverseRegistrar while the separate Ethereum Mainnet `L1Resolver` remains the execution owner (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L22 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L33 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L12 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L2/ReverseRegistrar.sol:L193 @ basenames@1809bbc) (upstream: .refs/basenames/src/L1/L1Resolver.sol:L13 @ basenames@1809bbc).

`basenames_offchain` remains a reserved catalog family for later explicit gateway admission and is not part of the current admitted Basenames split; upstream documents the off-chain gateway as a separate category from the shipped L1 resolver and Base authority contracts (upstream: .refs/basenames/README.md:L71 @ basenames@1809bbc).

This freeze does not create separate current source-family owners for registrar-controller, oracle, migration, proxy-admin, or offchain-gateway deployment artifacts. Later admission of those surfaces would be additive and doc-first.

## 5. Contract Instance Admission And Continuity

Manifest loading admits source-graph nodes as `contract_instance_id`s, not as raw addresses.

A manifest-declared root or contract instance keeps its ID only while the same declared contract address remains admitted on the same chain.

Rules:

- each active `[[roots]]` and `[[contracts]]` entry resolves to one admitted `contract_instance_id`
- `[[roots]]` seed canonical graph expansion and watch-plan expansion, but otherwise follow the same identity and continuity rules as `[[contracts]]`
- reusing the same declared address on the same chain across manifest versions, including after an inactive gap, carries forward the existing `contract_instance_id` and records a new non-overlapping active range
- changing a root or contract entry's own declared address closes the prior instance active range and admits a new `contract_instance_id`; any continuity to the predecessor is expressed by a `migration` edge, not by ID reuse
- when `proxy_kind != "none"`, the proxy address and the `implementation` address refer to separate contract instances linked by a time-ranged proxy / implementation edge
- changing only `implementation` keeps the proxy's `contract_instance_id`; reuse the prior implementation instance if that implementation address reappears, otherwise mint a new implementation instance

Contract addresses remain stored as time-ranged attributes for raw-fact matching and watch-plan expansion.

## 6. Discovery Admission Rules

A discovered contract becomes authoritative only if one of the following is true:

- it is declared directly in an active manifest
- it is reachable from an active manifest root through an allowed discovery rule
- it is explicitly allow-listed by manifest version for a migration epoch

Every admitted discovery edge stores:

- `from_contract_instance_id`
- `to_contract_instance_id`
- source manifest version
- edge kind
- discovery source
- active range
- provenance

Discovery uses raw addresses only as lookup inputs. It resolves `(chain, address, point in time)` to endpoint `contract_instance_id`s before storing the canonical edge.

If discovery re-admits an address that was admitted previously on the same chain and later became inactive, it reuses the prior `contract_instance_id` and records a new non-overlapping active range. It mints a new `contract_instance_id` only when that address has never been admitted on that chain.

Manifest-declared and discovered proxy / implementation links use the same edge and active-range rules.

## 7. Manifest Change Propagation

Manifest changes produce normalized events:

- `SourceManifestUpdated`
- `ProxyImplementationChanged`
- `CapabilityChanged`

They also:

- update discovery admission
- invalidate relevant execution cache entries
- trigger projection recomputation where capability boundaries change

## 8. Watch-Plan Expansion

Watch-plan expansion starts from active manifest roots by `contract_instance_id` and traverses active discovery edges by `contract_instance_id`.

Rules:

- the chain-intake watch target is the address range attached to each active contract instance at the requested time
- watch rows may denormalize address and code-hash state, but their durable explanation path is `manifest root -> discovery edge(s) -> contract_instance_id`
- address-only watch state is derived and may be rebuilt from manifests, contract-instance address attributes, and active discovery edges

## 9. Capability Policy

Capabilities gate behavior, not public-contract existence.

Rules:

- an unsupported capability must surface as `coverage.unsupported_reason` or a typed error
- shadow capabilities may write facts and traces without being enabled for general reads
- capability ownership attaches to the manifest-declared `source_family`; it is never implied by another family's presence
- ENSv2 Phase 5 capability ownership on the `sepolia-dev` alternate profile is source-family-local: registry admission does not imply registrar support, registrar admission does not imply resolver support, and resolver admission does not imply universal-resolver / execution support
- ENSv2 `sepolia-dev` exact-name profile support is not graduated by active rollout alone: while `exact_name_profile` is `shadow`, exact-name profile coverage remains public `unsupported`, and only a later `supported` capability value plus doc-first API/projection coverage update may graduate it (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistry.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309) (upstream: .refs/ens_v2/contracts/deployments/sepolia-dev/ETHRegistrar.json:L2 @ ens_v2@554c309)
- ENS verified resolution on Ethereum Mainnet is owned by `ens_execution` through contract role `universal_resolver` at `0xeEeEEEeE14D718C2B47D9923Deab1335E144EeEe`, not by `ens_v1_registry_l1`
- ENS reverse-claim intake on Ethereum Mainnet is anchored to `ens_v1_reverse_l1` through contract role `reverse_registrar` at `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`, not by `ens_v1_registry_l1` or `ens_v1_resolver_l1`
- ENS primary-name truth on Ethereum Mainnet is intentionally split across those owners: `ens_v1_reverse_l1` owns declared reverse-claim intake, while verification stays execution-derived rather than becoming a second manifest-owned claim surface
- that reverse-family ownership freezes only the current reverse-only ENS claim surface; any later fallback claim-setting surface would need its own manifest-owned source family and a later doc-first contract update
- the shipped Phase 7 ENS primary-name route does not require dedicated `claimed_primary_name` or `verified_primary_name` capability flags on either owner; reverse admission plus execution-owned persisted readback are enough for the current bootstrap contract
- `rollout_status` and `capability_flags` are source-family-local readiness inputs; they do not by themselves widen ENS claim precedence, combine reverse tuple intake with resolver-backed name payloads, collapse claimed and verified primary-name truth into one manifest capability, or graduate the bootstrap public coverage contract
- adding a new capability is additive if it does not change prior semantics

## 10. Ownership And Workflow

- manifest/discovery owners maintain the TOML files
- adapter owners consume manifest versions as inputs, not hidden configuration
- execution owners depend on manifest versions for cache keys and invalidation
- any manifest schema change requires a doc-first update to this file
