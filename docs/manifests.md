# Source Manifests

Manifests pin watched contracts, capability ownership, and rollout state per source family. They are part of the truth model, not deploy-time configuration. The wider model lives in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md); persistence in [`storage.md`](storage.md); intake in [`chain-intake.md`](chain-intake.md); execution in [`execution.md`](execution.md).

## File format and location

Manifests are TOML files at:

```text
manifests/<profile>/<chain_combo>/<namespace>/<source_family>/<version>.toml
```

Profiles select a corpus, and chain-combo directories partition the chains inside that corpus:

```text
manifests/mainnet/ethereum/<namespace>/<source_family>/v1.toml
manifests/mainnet/base/<namespace>/<source_family>/v1.toml
manifests/sepolia/ethereum/<namespace>/<source_family>/v1.toml
manifests/sepolia/base/<namespace>/<source_family>/v1.toml
```

One runtime selects exactly one manifest profile root at startup — `manifests/mainnet/` for the shipped mainnet profile, or `manifests/sepolia/` for the ENSv2 Sepolia profile. Profile selection is not a manifest schema change. A runtime never loads two profile roots into the same canonical corpus, watch plan, discovery graph, or projection set.

Within a selected profile root, the first directory component is the chain combo. It must match the leading component of each manifest `chain` ID: `ethereum-mainnet` lives under `ethereum/`, `base-mainnet` under `base/`, and `ethereum-sepolia` under `ethereum/`.

TOML is chosen for deterministic diffs, hand-editing, and straightforward Rust parsing.

## Required fields

Each manifest contains:

- `manifest_version`
- `namespace`
- `source_family`
- `chain`
- `deployment_epoch`
- `rollout_status` — `draft` | `shadow` | `active` | `deprecated`
- `normalizer_version`
- `capability_flags`
- `roots`
- `contracts`
- `discovery_rules`

Each `[[roots]]` and `[[contracts]]` entry may declare an optional `start_block`. `start_block` is the inclusive first historical block for that target. Omitted means unknown — adapters preserve that state rather than inferring zero, the current job range, the manifest activation height, or any other fallback.

For `[[contracts]]`, `proxy_kind` is required. `proxy_kind = "none"` omits `implementation`. Any non-`none` `proxy_kind` includes `implementation` as the current implementation address for that manifest version.

For `[[discovery_rules]]`, the only authorable `admission` value is `reachable_from_root` — the discovered edge is authoritative while its `from_role` endpoint remains reachable from an active manifest root under an allowed rule. Internal labels like `manifest_declared` and `manifest_successor` are storage tags, not authored values.

### `capability_flags`

Each flag carries a name, a status (`unsupported` | `shadow` | `supported`), and optional notes.

### `chain`

`chain` names the authority chain for that manifest within the selected profile. Mainnet manifests use chain IDs like `ethereum-mainnet` and `base-mainnet`. Sepolia support is additive as a separate manifest profile root and chain-ID set.

## Example shape

```toml
manifest_version = 1
namespace = "ens"
source_family = "ens_v2_registry_l1"
chain = "ethereum-mainnet"
deployment_epoch = "ens_v2"
rollout_status = "active"
normalizer_version = "uts46-v1"

[[roots]]
name = "RootRegistry"
address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
code_hash = "sha256:..."
abi_ref = "abis/ens_v2_root_registry.json"
start_block = 123456

[[contracts]]
role = "registry"
address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
proxy_kind = "none"
start_block = 123456

[[discovery_rules]]
edge_kind = "subregistry"
from_role = "registry"
admission = "reachable_from_root"

[capability_flags]
declared_children = "supported"
```

## Capability ownership

Capability ownership attaches to the declaring `source_family`. It is never implied by another family's presence.

### ENS mainnet

`ens_execution` owns verified resolution at the ENS Universal Resolver proxy `0xeEeEEEeE14D718C2B47D9923Deab1335E144EeEe` with `verified_resolution = "shadow"`.[^ens-docs-univ][^v1-ur-deploy][^v1-ursol-l8] The pinned `.refs/` artifact is the implementation/ABI anchor; the route-facing entry is the proxy address. The shadow flag records manifest ownership for the execution substrate; public ENS verified-resolution support is gated by the route-level support classes in `docs/api-v1-routes.md` and `docs/execution.md`, not by widening this manifest flag.

The ENS primary-name route does not introduce a second manifest capability. `ens_execution` remains the execution owner for exact-tuple persisted `verified_primary_name` readback under the same execution-owner manifest, without turning `verified_resolution = "shadow"` into a route-level primary-name support flag.

`ens_v1_reverse_l1` owns declared reverse-claim intake at the Mainnet `addr.reverse` Reverse Registrar `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`.[^v1-revreg-deploy][^v1-revreg-l15][^v1-revreg-l19] No dedicated `claimed_primary_name` flag is needed for the exact-tuple persisted-readback contract.

`ens_v1_registry_l1` owns the current ENS registry at `0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2E1E` with `start_block = 9380380`,[^subgraph-l15] plus `ENSRegistryOld` at `0x314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b` with `start_block = 3327417` as a migration-aware input.[^subgraph-l39][^subgraph-l44] Old-registry logs do not union with current logs by latest block: a current-registry `NewOwner` marks the node migrated; later old-registry `NewOwner`, `Transfer`, `NewTTL`, and non-root `NewResolver` updates for that node are suppressed.[^subgraph-ts-l134][^subgraph-ts-l230][^subgraph-ts-l238][^subgraph-ts-l246] Root-resolver updates from the old registry are the one frozen exception.[^v1-ensregfb-l40]

`ens_v1_registrar_l1` owns `.eth` BaseRegistrar at `start_block = 9380410`[^subgraph-l122] plus the legacy, wrapped, and current ETHRegistrarController contracts as label-bearing intake (LegacyEthRegistrarController `9380471`,[^subgraph-l145] WrappedETHRegistrarController `16925618`,[^v1-wrapethrc-l640] current ETHRegistrarController `22764821`).[^v1-ethrc-l706] Controllers do not split into a separate source-family owner.

`ens_v1_wrapper_l1` owns NameWrapper at `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401` with `start_block = 16925608`,[^v1-namewrapper-deploy] for wrapper authority, fuse/expiry, wrapper-revealed names, and wrapper-driven registry changes.[^v1-iname-l27][^v1-iname-l35][^v1-iname-l37][^v1-iname-l38]

`ens_v1_resolver_l1` owns ENS Labs PublicResolver-generation profile admission. The seed entry is the latest PublicResolver at `0xF29100983E058B709F3D539b0c765937B804AC15` with `start_block = 22764828`.[^v1-publicresolver-deploy] Resolver-profile admission is the gate for complete record-family coverage, resolver-overview support, latest-only behavior, and event-to-call parity. Unadmitted resolvers stay `pending` or `unsupported`.

Admitted ENS Labs PublicResolver generations on Ethereum Mainnet (first-party app-known data):[^v1-app-resolvers]

| Address | Profile | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0xF29100983E058B709F3D539b0c765937B804AC15` | latest: address, multicoin, default coin-type fallback, name, ABI, text, contenthash, DNS, interface, name-wrapper-aware, VersionableResolver | no pubkey or `DataResolver` |
| `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63` | as latest minus default coin-type fallback | no pubkey or `DataResolver` |
| `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41` | address, multicoin, name, ABI, text, contenthash, DNS, interface | no name-wrapper, no fallback, no Versionable, no pubkey/`DataResolver` |
| `0xDaaF96c344f63131acadD0Ea35170E7892d3dfBA` | same as `0x4976...` | same |
| `0x226159d592E2b063810a10Ebf6dcbADA94Ed68b8` | legacy: address, multicoin, name, ABI, text, contenthash, interface | no DNS, no name-wrapper, no fallback, no Versionable, no pubkey/`DataResolver` |
| `0x5FfC014343cd971B7eb70732021E26C35B744cc4` | older legacy: ETH-address, name, ABI, text, interface | no multicoin, contenthash, DNS, name-wrapper, fallback, Versionable, pubkey/`DataResolver` |
| `0x1da022710dF5002339274AaDEe8D58218e9D6AB5` | oldest legacy: ETH-address, name, ABI, interface | no text, contenthash, multicoin, DNS, name-wrapper, fallback, Versionable, pubkey/`DataResolver` |

Older rows do not inherit latest-only behavior. Unsupported interfaces and pending profiles surface explicitly through `coverage`, `UnsupportedSummary`, `resolver_family_pending`, or `resolver_family_unsupported`. They are never reported as absent records.

Address-specific resolver `start_block`s come from ENSNode datasource pins where available: `0x1da0...` `3648359`, `0x5FfC...` `3733668`, `0x2261...` `8659893`, `0x4976...` `9412610`, `0x231b...` `16925619`.[^ensnode-mainnet] `0xDaaF...` has no pinned datasource; it uses the current ENSRegistry epoch `9380380` as a conservative bootstrap basis. The OffchainDNSResolver and ExtendedDNSResolver app-known maps remain deferred — they are not PublicResolver-generation profile admissions.

Resolver discovery from registry `NewResolver(node, resolver)` admits the resolver as a `contract_instance_id` in `ens_v1_resolver_l1` and updates the node-to-resolver binding.[^v1-ens-l12][^v1-ensreg-l89][^v1-ensreg-l174] Zero-address observations close only that binding. Generic resolver-local events (`AddrChanged`, `AddressChanged`, `TextChanged`, `VersionChanged`) feed observed selector/cache facts; they do not graduate profile support.

`PubkeyChanged` is ignored by the current admission model. `DataResolver`-shaped events are unsupported on admitted generations and `pending` on unknown profiles. The generic `resolver_record` fact is an observation bucket; it does not act as a catch-all for unknown families.

### ENSv2 (`sepolia` profile)

The `sepolia` profile admits four ENSv2 Sepolia dev families under `manifests/sepolia/ethereum/ens/`:[^v2-deploy-root][^v2-deploy-ethreg][^v2-deploy-ethrc][^v2-deploy-pres]

- `ens_v2_root_l1` — `RootRegistry` at `0x3a3e15a5d27ff6f05c844313312f2e72096d3ed3`, `start_block = 10462881`. Tokenized, resource-scoped permissioned registry seed for discovery and parent graph state.[^v2-pr-l22][^v2-pr-l28]
- `ens_v2_registry_l1` — `ETHRegistry` at `0x796fff2e907449be8d5921bcc215b1b76d89d080`, `start_block = 10462895`, plus discovered `UserRegistry` proxy instances. `UserRegistryImpl` at `0xea93aff7375e8176053ab6ab36b57cab53cbf702` is implementation metadata, not a separate owner.[^v2-userreg-l15]
- `ens_v2_registrar_l1` — `ETHRegistrar` at `0x68586418353b771cf2425ed14a07512aa880c532`, `start_block = 10462909`. Registrar events and commit/renew facts; registered-name resource identity links back to the registry resource.[^v2-ethrc-l49][^v2-ethrc-l173]
- `ens_v2_resolver_l1` — `PermissionedResolver` resolver state, alias events, record-version events, resolver-scoped EAC permissions. `PermissionedResolverImpl` at `0xe566a1fbaf30ff7c39828fe99f955fc55544cb9c` is the initial implementation artifact.[^v2-pres-l38][^v2-pres-l70]

Exact-name profile promotion is profile-scoped: only `exact_name_profile = "supported"` on `ens_v2_registrar_l1` in the `sepolia` root graduates `.eth` exact-name declared reads, backed by `ETHRegistry` resource/token state and `ETHRegistrar` lifecycle facts.[^v2-iperm-l22][^v2-events-l15][^v2-iethreg-l32] The promotion does not apply to mainnet, other Sepolia profiles, or any runtime that has not selected `manifests/sepolia`. Active rollout, raw preimage observations, resolver admission, or backfill completion do not graduate any other capability.

Upstream events map to normalized adapter output: `TokenResource` → `TokenResourceLinked`, `TokenRegenerated` → `TokenRegenerated`, `SubregistryUpdated` → `SubregistryChanged`, `ParentUpdated` → `ParentChanged`, `AliasChanged` → `AliasChanged`, `EACRolesChanged` → resource- or resolver-scoped permission events.[^v2-iperm-l34][^v2-events-l49][^v2-events-l69][^v2-events-l75][^v2-iperm-resolver-l14][^v2-eac-l19] These are adapter semantics, not manifest schema fields.

Other `sepolia-dev` artifacts (`UniversalResolverV2`, `ReverseRegistry`, `DNSAliasResolver`, `WrapperRegistryImpl`, `LockedMigrationController`, `HCAFactory`, `StandardRentPriceOracle`, `BatchRegistrar`, `MockUSDC`, `MockDAI`) remain outside admission until a doc-first update.

### Basenames mainnet

Basenames mainnet admits six families:[^bn-readme-l22][^bn-readme-l28][^bn-readme-l29][^bn-readme-l33][^bn-readme-l34][^bn-readme-l69][^bn-readme-l70]

- `basenames_base_registry` — `registry` at `0xb94704422c2a1e396835a571837aa5ae53285a95` (Base). Per-node owner/resolver/ttl state.[^bn-registry-l10][^bn-registry-l100][^bn-registry-l113][^bn-registry-l132]
- `basenames_base_registrar` — `registrar` at `0x03c4738ee98ae44591e1a4a4f3cab6641d95dd9a` (Base). Tokenized authority owning `base.eth`, minting `*.base.eth` subdomains.[^bn-baseregistrar-l15][^bn-baseregistrar-l17][^bn-baseregistrar-l237][^bn-baseregistrar-l327]
- `basenames_base_resolver` — `resolver` at `0xC6d566A56A1aFf6508b41f6c90ff131615583BCD` (Base). Default `L2Resolver` profile seed.[^bn-l2resolver-l22][^bn-l2resolver-l49][^bn-l2resolver-l52][^bn-l2resolver-l193]
- `basenames_base_primary` — `reverse_registrar` at `0x79ea96012eea67a83431f1701b3dff7e37f9e282` (Base). Declared primary-claim intake only.[^bn-revreg-l12][^bn-revreg-l150][^bn-revreg-l193]
- `basenames_l1_compat` — `l1_resolver` at `0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31` (Ethereum). L1 compatibility transport for the `base.eth` domain.[^bn-l1resolver-l13]
- `basenames_execution` — `l1_resolver` at the same Ethereum address with `verified_resolution = "supported"` for the exact-surface transport-assisted direct-path class only. Execution entrypoint that initiates `OffchainLookup` and completes through `resolveWithProof`.[^bn-l1resolver-l154][^bn-l1resolver-l173][^bn-l1resolver-l191]

The L1 Resolver address appears in both `basenames_l1_compat` and `basenames_execution`. Transport ownership stays with `basenames_l1_compat`; execution entrypoint and verified-resolution routing stay with `basenames_execution`.

`basenames_execution` v2 promotes only the path class where `resolver_path[0].logical_name_id` equals the route surface, `wildcard.source = null`, `alias.final_target = null`, `subregistry_path = []`, `transport.source_chain_id = "base-mainnet"`, `transport.target_chain_id = "ethereum-mainnet"`, and `transport.contract_address = "0xde9049636F4a1dfE0a64d1bFe3155C0A14C54F31"`. Alias-participating, wildcard-derived, linked-subregistry, transport-free, and offchain-gateway classes return selector-local `unsupported`.[^bn-readme-l71]

`verified_primary_name` for Basenames runs through `basenames_execution` under the same flag. The matching `primary_names_current(address, coin_type, namespace)` row is the only claim-side anchor; `verified_primary_name.provenance` carries `{execution_trace_id, manifest_versions}` matching the top-level `execution_trace_id`.

Basenames Base-side resolver discovery from registry `NewResolver` admits resolver instances and updates bindings. Resolver-local fact consumption requires `L2Resolver`-compatible profile admission for the emitted family. The Base-side discovery rule does not discover the L1 Resolver and does not admit offchain gateways.[^bn-registry-l19][^bn-registry-l223][^bn-l2resolver-l4][^bn-l2resolver-l16][^bn-l2resolver-l29][^bn-l2resolver-l182][^bn-l2resolver-l209][^bn-l2resolver-l225]

`basenames_offchain` is reserved for later gateway admission. It is not part of the current split.

## Contract instance admission and continuity

Manifest loading admits source-graph nodes as `contract_instance_id`s, not raw addresses. Each active `[[roots]]` and `[[contracts]]` entry resolves to one admitted instance.

- `[[roots]]` seed canonical graph and watch-plan expansion; otherwise they follow the same identity rules as `[[contracts]]`.
- Reusing the same address on the same chain across manifest versions, even across an inactive gap, carries forward the existing `contract_instance_id` and appends a new non-overlapping active range.
- Changing a declared address closes the prior active range and admits a new instance. Continuity to the predecessor uses a `migration` edge, not ID reuse.
- `proxy_kind = "none"` resolves the declared address directly; `implementation` is omitted.
- `proxy_kind != "none"` requires `implementation`. The proxy and implementation are separate instances linked by a time-ranged proxy/implementation edge.
- Changing only `implementation` keeps the proxy's identity. The implementation instance is reused if its address reappears, otherwise a new one is minted.

Contract addresses persist as time-ranged attributes for raw-fact matching and watch-plan expansion.

## Discovery admission

A discovered contract is authoritative when one of these holds:

- it is declared directly in an active manifest
- it is reachable from an active manifest root through an allowed `discovery_rules` edge
- it is explicitly allow-listed by a manifest version for a migration epoch

Each admitted edge stores `from_contract_instance_id`, `to_contract_instance_id`, source manifest version, edge kind, discovery source, active range, and provenance.

Discovery resolves `(chain, address, point in time)` to endpoint `contract_instance_id`s before storing the edge. Re-admitting an address that was previously admitted on the same chain reuses the prior `contract_instance_id` and appends a new range; a new ID is minted only for addresses never admitted on that chain. Manifest-declared and discovered proxy/implementation links share the same edge and active-range rules.

## Manifest change propagation

Manifest changes produce normalized events: `SourceManifestUpdated`, `ProxyImplementationChanged`, `CapabilityChanged`. They update discovery admission, invalidate execution cache entries, and trigger projection recomputation where capability boundaries change.

Live manifest drift and proxy-upgrade alerting is a worker-owned operational loop. The worker computes drift candidates from admitted manifests, code-hash facts, proxy/implementation edges, and watch-plan state, and persists them to the worker-owned alert observation family. The worker does not write `normalized_events`, mutate manifests, mutate discovery admission, change capability flags, write projections, or expose a public route. Remediation is an explicit manifest or discovery change that produces the normal events above.

`bigname-worker manifest-drift audit --json` computes candidates, persists alert observations, and renders the persisted view alongside live counts. `--fail-on-alert --json` returns nonzero when actionable persisted alerts remain. `bigname-worker inspect manifest-drift --json` is read-only over already persisted observations.

## Watch-plan expansion

Watch-plan expansion starts from active manifest roots by `contract_instance_id` and traverses active discovery edges by ID.

- The chain-intake watch target is the address range attached to each active contract instance at the requested time.
- If a manifest target carries `start_block`, the materialized watch range starts at that inclusive block unless a later active-range boundary narrows it.
- If `start_block` is omitted, the historical start is unknown. Live watch may still produce a target; automatic historical bootstrap treats it as unbootstrapable until a finite start is declared.
- Watch rows may denormalize address and code-hash state, but their durable explanation path is `manifest root → discovery edge(s) → contract_instance_id`.
- Address-only watch state is rebuildable from manifests, instance attributes, and active discovery edges.

`bigname-worker inspect watch-plan --json` exposes active watched contracts with source kind (`manifest_root`, `manifest_contract`, `discovery_edge`), source families, contract instance IDs, chain addresses, source manifest IDs, and active block ranges. It is read-only over existing state.

## Capability policy

Capabilities gate behavior, not public-contract existence. An unsupported capability surfaces as `coverage.unsupported_reason` or a typed error. Shadow capabilities write facts and traces without enabling general reads. Adding a new capability is additive only when it does not change prior semantics.

## Ownership

- Manifest/discovery owners maintain the TOML files.
- Adapter owners consume manifest versions as inputs.
- Execution owners depend on manifest versions for cache keys and invalidation.
- Schema changes require a doc-first update to this file.

## Bootstrap `start_block` provenance

Known historical starts cite a pinned upstream source. Targets without a pinned source omit `start_block`; automatic bootstrap skips them rather than inventing values. Basenames mainnet families and the ENS Universal Resolver remain unknown.
