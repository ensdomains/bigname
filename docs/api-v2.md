# API v2

Development-time contract for the API surface accepted in
[ADR 0006](adrs/0006-api-v2-product-surface.md). Per-route reference lives in
[`api-v2-routes.md`](api-v2-routes.md). The generated OpenAPI document is not
part of this docs-only rollout step; it is generated from the route table in
the implementation step.

## Contract Principles

`v2` is designed around three rules:

1. **One vocabulary.** Every domain concept has exactly one wire name, drawn
   from common ENS/blockchain usage, defined in the naming dictionary below,
   and used identically on every route.
2. **One envelope.** Every route returns `data`, plus `page` on collections,
   plus `meta`. Field budgets may subset fields but never rename, retype, or
   restructure them.
3. **Three tiers.** Lookup primitives, product reads, and diagnostics are
   separate route families. The route path decides the tier; a query parameter
   never switches a route into another tier.

## Versioning

`v2` is a development designation only. The new surface is built under `/v2`
alongside the frozen `v1`, passes the one-time parity gate, and then ships as
the re-baselined `v1`: old `v1` routes are deleted and the `/v2` prefix is
renamed to `/v1` in the same release. No permanent `/v2` prefix ships as the
public contract.

Until that switch, `docs/api-v1.md` and `docs/api-v1-routes.md` are frozen
except for corrections. These `api-v2` docs are the development-time contract
that step 3 implements.

## Naming Dictionary

Normative one-name-per-concept dictionary from ADR 0006, extended with the

`GET /v2/permissions` and `GET /v2/addresses/{address}/names?include=role_summary`
require the compatible projection-owned permission publication version before
permission rows are served. Missing or older versions return `409 stale`. These reads
also verify the publication's read-consistency revision is unchanged before
returning; an interleaved keyed or full publication returns `409 stale` rather
than a mixed-generation response. These are schema/publication compatibility
and request-coherence guards; they do not assert projection freshness.
The base v2 address-name collection remains available without the expansion.

Permission-backed v2 reads also classify the served resources from the typed
projection-owned per-resource permission summary. For a resource-bound
`GET /v2/permissions` read, a missing or partial summary produces
`meta.completeness=partial` with `permission_support_unknown`; an ENSv1 wrapper
summary produces `meta.completeness=unsupported` with
`wrapper_holder_permissions_not_supported`. An address-only permissions read
is always at least `partial` with the wrapper reason because a wrapper resource
with zero holder rows cannot be discovered from the permission-row collection.
For `include=role_summary`, any non-full resource summary makes the overall
address-name response `partial`, lists `role_summary` in
`meta.unsupported_fields`, and uses the same product reason mapping. Projected
permission rows remain visible, but an empty or populated expansion is not
authoritative when that metadata is present. Missing summary metadata takes
precedence over the known wrapper limitation when both occur on one page.

Rules:

- Timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC everywhere, including the lookup route.
- JSON map keys are strings (`"60"`, `"8453"`); `chain_id` as an object field
  is a JSON number.
- `token_id` stays a decimal string.
- Pipeline vocabulary (`projection`, `sidecar`, `manifest`, `normalized event`,
  `raw fact`, table names) must not appear in product-route field names, enum
  values, or error messages.

## Envelope

One success shape applies to every route:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "page": {
    "cursor": null,
    "next_cursor": "opaque-token",
    "page_size": 50,
    "total_count": 123,
    "has_more": true
  },
  "meta": {
    "as_of": {
      "1": {
        "block_number": 19000000,
        "block_hash": "0x...",
        "timestamp": "2026-06-10T00:00:00Z"
      }
    },
    "as_of_token": "opaque-token",
    "completeness": "partial",
    "unsupported_fields": ["role_summary"],
    "unsupported_reason": "not_supported_for_namespace",
    "source": "indexed"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `data` is an object on single-resource routes and an array on collections.
- Top-level `page` appears on collection routes only. Per-input pagination on
  `POST /v2/lookup` and the nested resolver-overview `bound_names` collection
  use the same object inside their containing result/object.
- `total_count` is nullable. It is populated where a precomputed count makes
  it cheap or where a route explicitly documents `include=total_count`. Routes
  must not run unconditional full counts on the request path to fill it.
- `meta` is always present. Single-resource routes that read chain-derived state
  include `meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token` when they can attribute at least
  one served snapshot-pinned chain position. Top-level collection routes omit
  both because their mutable latest-state rows are not bound to one snapshot.
  Control-plane routes (`/v2/status`, `/v2/namespaces/{namespace}`) and verified
  name-profile responses served by the route-local on-demand fallback also
  omit both. `meta.as_of` is human-readable staleness attribution on routes
  that provide it. `meta.as_of_token` is opaque and is the value to pass to
  `at` when a route supports snapshot replay. `meta.completeness`,
  `meta.unsupported_fields`, and `meta.unsupported_reason` appear only when the
  read is not clean. `meta.source` appears when the route supports `source`.
- `meta.unsupported_fields` names response-level sections or expansions the
  route could not serve. Record-level `unsupported_fields` names data fields
  the index could not prove for that record. One unsupported field is not
  duplicated at both levels in one response.
- There is no `meta` query parameter and no stripped envelope variant.
- There are no `declared_state`/`verified_state` parallel trees and no `both`
  mode.

## Field Budgets

`include` is a route-documented expansion allowlist. It may add documented
sections or route-documented expensive metadata. No route supports
`include=total_count` unless that route's parameter list says so.

`profile=feed` on `POST /v2/lookup` is a field budget over the same record
shape used by `profile=detail`. Feed returns fewer fields; every feed field has
the same name and type as its detail counterpart. Feed does not change reverse
lookup pagination semantics: `cursor`, `page_size`, `next_cursor`, and
`has_more` mean the same thing as detail.

Flat record optional fields are omitted when there is no backed value. Routes
do not serialize permanently-null placeholders for optionals such as `manager`.
Known-empty maps on detail records, such as `addresses` and `text_records`,
serialize as `{}`; omission means the field is outside the requested field
budget or unsupported by the served source.

## Tiers

### Tier 1: Lookup Primitives

Lookup primitives serve the partner latency path and current indexing status:

- `POST /v2/lookup`
- `GET /v2/status`

The lookup route uses the common record shape and in-band per-result statuses.
`GET /v2/status` is the only route with the ops status vocabulary
`ready`, `degraded`, `stale`. It exposes the live invalidation count exactly
through 10,000, marks larger queues with
`pending_invalidation_count_capped=true`, and reports the dead-letter count plus
cached network-head comparison evidence. Provider refresh runs
asynchronously under a timeout and cache TTL, so the route never waits for a
provider. A failed latest refresh degrades readiness immediately while keeping
the last successful head comparison visible as cached evidence.

### Tier 2: Product Reads

Product routes serve app and public read workflows. They must use only product
vocabulary in field names, enum values, and error messages. Product routes may
expose simplified `completeness`, `unsupported_fields`, and per-item `status`,
but they must not expose pipeline internals.

The product-route denylist includes pipeline terms such as `projection`,
`sidecar`, `manifest`, `normalized event`, `raw fact`, storage table names,
`logical_name_id`, `resource_id`, `token_lineage_id`,
`surface_binding_id`, `binding_kind`, `normalized_event_id`,
`raw_fact_refs`, `manifest_versions`, `derivation_kind`,
`exhaustiveness`, `enumeration_basis`, `source_classes_considered`, and the
`execution_checkpoint` pseudo-chain slot. If a product capability needs that
detail, it belongs on a diagnostics route instead.

### Tier 3: Diagnostics

Diagnostics are the only public routes that may carry pipeline vocabulary.
They expose coverage taxonomy, binding and authority explanations, record
inventory/cache internals, persisted execution explanations, active manifests,
and raw normalized-event rows.

## Parameters

Common parameter rules:

| Parameter | Applies to | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `at` | Tier-2 single-resource snapshot reads: names, records, and resolver overview; diagnostics exact-name snapshot/explain routes. Top-level collection routes recognize `at` only to return the temporary latest-state limitation error. Lookup, status, primary-name, and namespace metadata do not accept it. | RFC 3339 timestamp, or the URL-safe opaque snapshot token from `meta.as_of_token` |
| `finality` | Single-resource snapshot reads and diagnostics exact-name snapshot/explain routes accept `latest` (default), `safe`, and `finalized`. Top-level collection routes accept only omitted or explicit `latest`. Lookup, status, primary-name, and namespace metadata do not accept it. | `latest` (default), `safe`, `finalized` where supported |
| `source` | names, records, primary-name | names and records use `indexed` (default) or `verified`; the records route also accepts `auto`; primary-name omits `source` to return all supported source answers and may use `indexed` or `verified` to request a subset |
| `namespace` | name-inferred, address-anchored, and collection routes | explicit override or filter |
| `include` | route-documented expansions | per-route allowlist |
| `sort`, `order` | paginated routes that declare a sort set | route-documented field set plus `asc`/`desc` |
| `cursor`, `page_size` | every paginated route | opaque cursor; default 50, max 200 |

Unknown or undocumented query parameters are rejected with `400 invalid_input`
on every `v2` route. As a documented temporary exception, latest-state
collection routes recognize `at`, `finality=safe`, and `finality=finalized` so
they can return the limitation errors defined below instead of implying
snapshot support.
Snapshot-pinned reads require the ADR 0003 slice-3 snapshot-service enabler;
ADR 0006 rollout step 3 includes that read-layer work.

## Status Vocabulary

One result-status vocabulary is used everywhere except the `/v2/status` ops
route:

- `ok`
- `not_found`
- `invalid_name`
- `mismatch`
- `unsupported`
- `stale`
- `failed`

Rules:

- `unsupported_reason` is required when `status=unsupported`.
- `failure_reason` is permitted on `failed`, `stale`, `not_found`, and
  `mismatch`.
- `mismatch` is the verification state where a claimed answer verifies to a
  different value.
- `completeness` is `full`, `partial`, or `unsupported`.
- Empty arrays and empty maps mean known-empty, not unknown.

## Finality And Snapshots

`finality` values are `latest`, `safe`, and `finalized`. Snapshot selection is
uniform across single-resource snapshot-read routes. Each such chain-derived
response carries `meta.as_of`, keyed by stringified `chain_id`, and
`meta.as_of_token`, an opaque token that can round-trip as `at` to pin exact
per-chain positions. Tokens must cover every required slot in the target
route's snapshot scope and must not carry extra slots outside that scope.

Top-level collections page over mutable latest-state tables. They therefore
omit `meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token`, and their cursors do not claim a
snapshot bound. Newly issued collection cursors carry no snapshot token; a
legacy cursor's snapshot component is ignored rather than treated as a
validity condition. Omitted `finality` and explicit `finality=latest` are accepted.
An `at` selector returns `400 invalid_input` with
`at is not supported because collection routes read latest state`.
`finality=safe` and `finality=finalized` return `400 invalid_input` with
`finality must be latest because collection routes read latest state`.

This is issue #188 option 2. Option 1 is the storage follow-up: bind every page
to an immutable publication revision and return explicit cursor-expired
semantics when that revision is no longer available. Once revision-bound
cursors and row reads land, the collection `at` and historical `finality`
restrictions lift and collection snapshot metadata can be restored.

`POST /v2/lookup` is a current-state read. It does not accept `at` or
`finality`; when a served head is available, its `meta.as_of` and
`meta.as_of_token` record the served positions for staleness attribution and
shadow-diff correlation. Lookup rejects partial scoped heads instead of
emitting a token that cannot replay on a compatible snapshot-read route.

`GET /v2/addresses/{address}/primary-name` is also a current-state read. It
does not accept `at` or `finality`; when a served head is available, its
`meta.as_of` and `meta.as_of_token` record the served positions for staleness
attribution and shadow-diff correlation. When the ENS/60 route-local on-demand
fallback supplies the answer instead of projection state, both metadata fields
record the stored selected Ethereum checkpoint that pins the verified calls and
the persisted execution trace. Basenames responses that serve a persisted
verified answer include both the Base authority position and the Ethereum
resolution-auxiliary position; indexed-only responses and missing persisted
verified outcomes remain Base-scoped.

The `chain_positions` query parameter from `v1` does not exist in `v2`.

## Cursors And Pagination

Cursors are opaque and versioned. They are not bound to the route path string,
so route evolution does not invalidate outstanding cursors. Top-level
collection cursors bind the collection anchor, namespace, filters, and sort,
but not a snapshot. They preserve keyset position across requests without
claiming that the mutable dataset is frozen. A legacy collection cursor's
snapshot component is ignored. Snapshot-bound cursor semantics remain on
single-resource responses with nested pagination where documented.

Every collection uses `cursor`, `next_cursor`, `page_size`, nullable
`total_count`, and `has_more`. Default `page_size` is 50; maximum is 200.

## Error Model

Error envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unsupported",
    "message": "the requested route option is not supported",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Uniform mapping:

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_input` | 400 | malformed input, unnormalizable path name, bad parameter combination |
| `not_found` | 404 | single-resource GET with no answer |
| `unsupported` | 422 | the route cannot produce its contract for this input |
| `stale` | 409 | coherent selector not yet served for the selected snapshot |
| `conflict` | 409 | selector cannot form one canonical snapshot |
| `request_timeout` | 408 | the whole request exceeded the configured deadline |
| `rate_limited` | 429 | the enabled client limit, keyed by an IPv4 address or IPv6 `/64`, rejected a route that can trigger verified execution |
| `overloaded` | 503 | the process-wide, health-specific, or verified-execution in-flight ceiling was exhausted |
| `internal_error` | 500 | unexpected failure |

Rules:

- `unsupported` is `422`.
- Verified record-resolution failures surface as `status: "failed"` on the
  affected section with `failure_reason`, or as `stale` when the RPC provider
  cannot serve the selected block. Provider connect and response timeouts for
  that path use the existing in-band execution-failure behavior; they are not
  whole-request `408` responses. Other provider transport failures during
  verified record resolution surface as `stale` and do not cache an execution
  outcome. The ENS/60 primary-name fallback uses the same transport split:
  configured provider timeouts remain persisted in-band failures, while DNS,
  TLS, connection-reset, and other non-timeout transport failures return
  whole-request `409 stale` before persistence.
- Every route has a whole-request deadline. `/healthz`, `/v1/status`, and
  `/v2/status` retain that deadline as their final backstop. `/healthz` bypasses
  the process-wide concurrency limiter and load shedding, uses a reserved
  one-connection database pool with a two-second check limit, and has a small
  independent health ceiling. HTTP-concurrency saturation and request-pool
  exhaustion therefore do not queue the probe; a failed or timed-out readiness
  connection reports the database as unreachable. The status routes retain
  global admission because their aggregate database query is not a liveness
  probe.
- The verified-execution rate limit, when enabled, and all in-flight ceilings
  reject work before it waits for execution capacity. The rate-limit key is an
  IPv4 address or IPv6 `/64`; `/healthz` passes only through the health-specific
  ceiling. `GET /v2/names/{name}/records?source=auto` with omitted or empty
  `keys` is an indexed read and does not enter verified-execution admission.
- Single-resource GETs return `404 not_found` when no answer exists.
- Collections return `200` with empty `data`.
- Batch lookup results carry in-band `status` per input; a batch never returns
  `404` for one missing input.
- The primary-name route is the documented exception to single-resource `404`:
  a valid `{address, coin_type, namespace}` tuple with no claim or an
  unsupported/mismatched verification returns `200` with in-band `status`.
- Error messages must not name internal storage or pipeline components.
